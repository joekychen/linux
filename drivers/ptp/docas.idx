This patch adds an infrastructure for hardware clocks that implement IEEE 1588, the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). A class driver offers a registration method to particular hardware clock drivers. Each clock is presented as a standard POSIX clock.  The ancillary clock features are exposed in two different ways, via the sysfs and by a character device.

Commit e77bd1ec121ee4163a6b42a44e87b2e382c39e04 added support for a new ethtool function, but that cannot compile due to a misnamed global variable. Not that it really matters (since the IXP4xx does compile either, as of about Linux 3.1) but just in case, this patch fixes the misnamed variable in the PHC driver.
