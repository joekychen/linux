f | st5481_init.c | s | 5.3K | 182 | Sarah Sharp | sarah.a.sharp@linux.intel.com | 1337380975 |  | USB: Disable hub-initiated LPM for comms devices.  Hub-initiated LPM is not good for USB communications devices.  Comms devices should be able to tell when their link can go into a lower power state, because they know when an incoming transmission is finished. Ideally, these devices would slam their links into a lower power state, using the device-initiated LPM, after finishing the last packet of their data transfer.  If we enable the idle timeouts for the parent hubs to enable hub-initiated LPM, we will get a lot of useless LPM packets on the bus as the devices reject LPM transitions when they're in the middle of receiving data.  Worse, some devices might blindly accept the hub-initiated LPM and power down their radios while they're in the middle of receiving a transmission.  The Intel Windows folks are disabling hub-initiated LPM for all USB communications devices under a xHCI USB 3.0 host.  In order to keep the Linux behavior as close as possible to Windows, we need to do the same in Linux.  Set the disable_hub_initiated_lpm flag for for all USB communications drivers.  I know there aren't currently any USB 3.0 devices that implement these class specifications, but we should be ready if they do.

f | hfc_usb.c | s | 43K | 1451 | Sarah Sharp | sarah.a.sharp@linux.intel.com | 1337380975 |  | USB: Disable hub-initiated LPM for comms devices.  Hub-initiated LPM is not good for USB communications devices.  Comms devices should be able to tell when their link can go into a lower power state, because they know when an incoming transmission is finished. Ideally, these devices would slam their links into a lower power state, using the device-initiated LPM, after finishing the last packet of their data transfer.  If we enable the idle timeouts for the parent hubs to enable hub-initiated LPM, we will get a lot of useless LPM packets on the bus as the devices reject LPM transitions when they're in the middle of receiving data.  Worse, some devices might blindly accept the hub-initiated LPM and power down their radios while they're in the middle of receiving a transmission.  The Intel Windows folks are disabling hub-initiated LPM for all USB communications devices under a xHCI USB 3.0 host.  In order to keep the Linux behavior as close as possible to Windows, we need to do the same in Linux.  Set the disable_hub_initiated_lpm flag for for all USB communications drivers.  I know there aren't currently any USB 3.0 devices that implement these class specifications, but we should be ready if they do.
