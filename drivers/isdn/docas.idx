These changes have all been in his tree for more than a week, and    therefore have had the necessary -next exposure.  John was just away    on a trip and didn't have a change to send the pull request until a    day or two ago.  2) Put back some defines in user exposed header file areas that were    removed during the tokenring purge.  From Stephen Hemminger and Paul    Gortmaker.  3) A bug fix for UDP hash table allocation got lost in the pile due to    one of those "you got it..  no I've got it.." situations.  :-)     From Tim Bird.  4) SKB coalescing in TCP needs to have stricter checks, otherwise we'll    try to coalesce overlapping frags and crash.  Fix from Eric Dumazet.  5) RCU routing table lookups can race with free_fib_info(), causing    crashes when we deref the device pointers in the route.  Fix by    releasing the net device in the RCU callback.  From Yanmin Zhang.  * git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net: (293 commits)   tcp: take care of overlaps in tcp_try_coalesce()   ipv4: fix the rcu race between free_fib_info and ip_route_output_slow   mm: add a low limit to alloc_large_system_hash   ipx: restore token ring define to include/linux/ipx.h   if: restore token ring ARP type to header   xen: do not disable netfront in dom0   phy/micrel: Fix ID of KSZ9021   mISDN: Add X-Tensions USB ISDN TA XC-525   gianfar:don't add FCB length to hard_header_len   Bluetooth: Report proper error number in disconnection   Bluetooth: Create flags for bt_sk()   Bluetooth: report the right security level in getsockopt   Bluetooth: Lock the L2CAP channel when sending   Bluetooth: Restore locking semantics when looking up L2CAP channels   Bluetooth: Fix a redundant and problematic incoming MTU check   Bluetooth: Add support for Foxconn/Hon Hai AR5BBU22 0489:E03C   Bluetooth: Fix EIR data generation for mgmt_device_found   Bluetooth: Fix Inquiry with RSSI event mask   Bluetooth: improve readability of l2cap_seq_list code   Bluetooth: Fix skb length calculation   ...

d | hisax |  | 100 items |  | Sarah Sharp | sarah.a.sharp@linux.intel.com | 1337380975 |  | USB: Disable hub-initiated LPM for comms devices.  Hub-initiated LPM is not good for USB communications devices.  Comms devices should be able to tell when their link can go into a lower power state, because they know when an incoming transmission is finished. Ideally, these devices would slam their links into a lower power state, using the device-initiated LPM, after finishing the last packet of their data transfer.  If we enable the idle timeouts for the parent hubs to enable hub-initiated LPM, we will get a lot of useless LPM packets on the bus as the devices reject LPM transitions when they're in the middle of receiving data.  Worse, some devices might blindly accept the hub-initiated LPM and power down their radios while they're in the middle of receiving a transmission.  The Intel Windows folks are disabling hub-initiated LPM for all USB communications devices under a xHCI USB 3.0 host.  In order to keep the Linux behavior as close as possible to Windows, we need to do the same in Linux.  Set the disable_hub_initiated_lpm flag for for all USB communications drivers.  I know there aren't currently any USB 3.0 devices that implement these class specifications, but we should be ready if they do.
