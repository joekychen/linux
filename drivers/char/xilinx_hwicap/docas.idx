This allows the hardware enough time to write configuration frames during partial reconfiguration. In case of 10 the driver returns an error, although it should just have polled the register longer.  Tested on an ML605 board. The patch is against the latest linus-tree.

f | Makefile | g | 164B |  | Stephen Neuendorffer | stephen.neuendorffer@xilinx.com | 1202318632 |  | [POWERPC] Xilinx: hwicap driver  This includes code for new fifo-based xps_hwicap in addition to the older opb_hwicap, which has a significantly different interface.  The common code between the two drivers is largely shared.  Significant differences exists between this driver and what is supported in the EDK drivers.  In particular, most of the architecture-specific code for reconfiguring individual FPGA resources has been removed.  This functionality is likely better provided in a user-space support library.  In addition, read and write access is supported.  In addition, although the xps_hwicap cores support interrupt-driver mode, this driver only supports polled operation, in order to make the code simpler, and since the interrupt processing overhead is likely to slow down the throughput under Linux.
