This appears to be too short for some hardware.  The IPMI spec says "All system software wait loops should include error timeouts. For simplicity, such timeouts are not shown explicitly in the flow diagrams.  A five-second timeout or greater is recommended".  Change the timeout to five seconds to satisfy the slow hardware.
