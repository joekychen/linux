The structure is still referenced in the drivers subsystem, and can be accesseed through sysfs, so the modpost warning is a false positive. Mark it as such.  In the same time, the warning referenced in 005bdad7b80 did only mention `pci_eisa_driver', not `pci_eisa_pci_tbl', so remove its marking.

Instead, the functions dev_get_drvdata() and dev_set_drvdata() should be used.  These functions have been around since the beginning, so are backwards compatible with all older kernel versions.

Descriptions taken from the respective EISA configuration files.  It's unlikely we'll ever support these cards, the problem being the lack of documentation.  Assuming the policy for the EISA ID database is the same as for PCI I'm sending these entries for the sake of completeness.  Signed-off-by: Maciej W.
