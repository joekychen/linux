The extcon-max8997 driver is implemented based on 'drivers/misc/ max8997-muic.c' and then use Extcon interface instead of callback function in struct max8997_muic_platform_data to notify cable state of notifee which want to know always newly cable state when external connector(e.g., USB, TA, JIG) is attached or detached.  v1 - Use Extcon interface to notify cable state of notifee instead of  callback function when external connector is attached or detached. - Bug fix of getting platform_data for irq_base value.
