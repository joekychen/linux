This patch fixes a couple of bugs in the DMA support in the driver, so once the corresponding FPGA update is complete and tested everything should work properly.  We weren't storing the currently-transmitting skb, so we were never unmapping it and never freeing/popping it when the TX was done. And the addition of pci_set_master() is fairly self-explanatory.
