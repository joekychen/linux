d | fusion |  | 16 items |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1338513018 |  | Merge branch 'akpm' (Andrew's patch-bomb)  Merge misc patches from Andrew Morton:   - the "misc" tree - stuff from all over the map   - checkpatch updates   - fatfs   - kmod changes   - procfs   - cpumask   - UML   - kexec   - mqueue   - rapidio   - pidns   - some checkpoint-restore feature work.  Reluctantly.  Most of it    delayed a release.  I'm still rather worried that we don't have a    clear roadmap to completion for this work.  * emailed from Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>: (78 patches)   kconfig: update compression algorithm info   c/r: prctl: add ability to set new mm_struct::exe_file   c/r: prctl: extend PR_SET_MM to set up more mm_struct entries   c/r: procfs: add arg_start/end, env_start/end and exit_code members to /proc/$pid/stat   syscalls, x86: add __NR_kcmp syscall   fs, proc: introduce /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children entry   sysctl: make kernel.ns_last_pid control dependent on CHECKPOINT_RESTORE   aio/vfs: cleanup of rw_copy_check_uvector() and compat_rw_copy_check_uvector()   eventfd: change int to __u64 in eventfd_signal()   fs/nls: add Apple NLS   pidns: make killed children autoreap   pidns: use task_active_pid_ns in do_notify_parent   rapidio/tsi721: add DMA engine support   rapidio: add DMA engine support for RIO data transfers   ipc/mqueue: add rbtree node caching support   tools/selftests: add mq_perf_tests   ipc/mqueue: strengthen checks on mqueue creation   ipc/mqueue: correct mq_attr_ok test   ipc/mqueue: improve performance of send/recv   selftests: add mq_open_tests   ...
d | i2o |  | 19 items |  | Paul Gortmaker | paul.gortmaker@windriver.com | 1337295973 |  | MCA: delete all remaining traces of microchannel bus support.  Hardware with MCA bus is limited to 386 and 486 class machines that are now 20+ years old and typically with less than 32MB of memory.  A quick search on the internet, and you see that even the MCA hobbyist/enthusiast community has lost interest in the early 2000 era and never really even moved ahead from the 2.4 kernels to the 2.6 series.  This deletes anything remaining related to CONFIG_MCA from core kernel code and from the x86 architecture.  There is no point in carrying this any further into the future.  One complication to watch for is inadvertently scooping up stuff relating to machine check, since there is overlap in the TLA name space (e.g. arch/x86/boot/mca.c).

f | Makefile | g | 102B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
