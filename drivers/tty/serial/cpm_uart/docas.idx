f | cpm_uart_core.c | s | 34K | 1208 | Jiri Slaby | jslaby@suse.cz | 1316731766 |  | TTY: serial, fix includes in some drivers  linux/tty_flip.h is included in linux/serial_core.h. But this may (and will) change in the future. Then we would get build errors such as: .../tty/serial/max3107.c: In function ‘put_data_to_circ_buf’: .../tty/serial/max3107.c:149:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘tty_insert_flip_string’  So fix all the drviers which call tty flip buffer helpers to really include linux/tty_flip.h. And also make sure that those include linux/tty.h when operating with struct tty_struct.

f | Makefile | g | 288B |  | Greg Kroah-Hartman | gregkh@suse.de | 1294949418 |  | tty: move drivers/serial/ to drivers/tty/serial/  The serial drivers are really just tty drivers, so move them to drivers/tty/ to make things a bit neater overall.  This is part of the tty/serial driver movement proceedure as proposed by Arnd Bergmann and approved by everyone involved a number of months ago.
