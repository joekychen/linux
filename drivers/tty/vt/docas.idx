We don't at this point guarantee not to race the keyboard code but the results of that appear harmless and that was true before we started as well.  We now have no users of tty_lock in the console driver...  Signed-off-by: Alan Cox <alan@linux.intel.com> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
