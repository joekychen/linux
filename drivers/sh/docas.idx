This follows the MSTP clock change and implements variable access size support for the rest of the CPG clocks, too. Upcoming SH-2A support has need of this for 16-bit div4 clocks, while others will follow.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>

d | intc |  | 12 items |  | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1337681275 |  | sh: intc: Kill off special reservation interface.  At present reserving the IRLs in the IRQ bitmap in addition to the dropping of the legacy IRQ pre-allocation prevent IRL IRQs from being allocated for the x3proto board.  The only reason to permit reservations was to lock down possible hardware vectors prior to dynamic IRQ scanning, but this doesn't matter much given that the hardware controller configuration is sorted before we get around to doing any dynamic IRQ allocation anyways. Beyond that, all of the tables are __init annotated, so quite a bit more work would need to be done to support reconfiguring things like IRL controllers on the fly, much more than would ever make it worth the hassle.

f | Kconfig | g | 84B |  | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1286284230 |  | sh: intc: Split up the INTC code.  This splits up the sh intc core in to something more vaguely resembling a subsystem. Most of the functionality was alread fairly well compartmentalized, and there were only a handful of interdependencies that needed to be resolved in the process.  This also serves as future-proofing for the genirq and sparseirq rework, which will make some of the split out functionality wholly generic, allowing things to be killed off in place with minimal migration pain.
