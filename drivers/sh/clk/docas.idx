f | cpg.c | s | 9.6K | 332 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1334227840 |  | sh: clkfwk: Support variable size accesses for div4/div6 clocks.  This follows the MSTP clock change and implements variable access size support for the rest of the CPG clocks, too. Upcoming SH-2A support has need of this for 16-bit div4 clocks, while others will follow.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>

f | Makefile | g | 51B |  | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1287405178 |  | sh: clkfwk: Shuffle around to match the intc split up.  This shuffles the clock framework code around to a drivers/sh/clk subdir, to follow the intc split up. This will make it easier to subsequently break things out as well as plug in different helpers for non-CPG users.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
