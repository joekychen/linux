I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
f | superhyway-sysfs.c | s | 1.3K | 40 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1131378808 |  | [PATCH] superhyway: multiple block support and VCR rework  This extends the API somewhat to allow for platform-specific VCR reading and writing.  Some platforms (like SH4-202) implement the VCR in a split VCRL and VCRH, but end up being in reverse order or have other quirks that need to be dealt with, so we add a set of superhyway_ops per-bus to accomodate this.  We also have to extend the per-device resources somewhat, as some devices now conveniently split control and data blocks.  So we allow a platform to register its set of SuperHyway devices via superhyway_add_devices() with the control block always ordered as the first resource (as this is the one that userspace cares about).
