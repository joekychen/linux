It is because the tty handling in the driver is really broken.  There was some activity in January 2012 to fix the driver, but the patch was commented to be bogus:   https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/29/160 and we have not heard back from the author since then:   https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/28/412  So since nobody stepped in and rewrote the driver, it is time to move it out of line now. And drop it some time later if nobody comes up with patches to fix the driver in staging.  Signed-off-by: Jiri Slaby <jslaby@suse.cz> Acked-by: David S.
