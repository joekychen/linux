f | rtl_eeprom.c | s | 3.6K | 119 | Sean MacLennan | seanm@seanm.ca | 1322650242 |  | rtl8192e: Split into two directories  Now that the rtl8192e driver is split up, it makes sense to keep the rtllib code in one directory and the rtl8192e specific code in another. This patch contains the split and the fixup of includes.  Since rtl_core.h already included rtllib.h and dot11d.h, rtl_core.h was updated to point to the parent directory. All other references to rtllib.h and dot11d.h in the rtl8192e specific code where deleted rather than fixed. This leaves just one file that needs to know the real location of the rtllib includes.
