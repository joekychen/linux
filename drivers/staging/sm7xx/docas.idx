This function is not implemented like a generic function for frame buffer. Having the old prefix becomes confused when reading fb_ops structs.  Tested with SM712  Signed-off-by: Javier M.

f | TODO | g | 305B |  | Javier M. Mellid | jmunhoz@igalia.com | 1304731993 |  | staging: sm7xx: Use kernel framebuffer mode setting  This patch implements dynamic framebuffer mode setting.  Previous code works with mode setting in a hard code way. Previous hard code configuration is used as default configuration if dynamic mode setting or boot mode setting (via sm712vga_setup) is not used.  Tested with SM712 supporting 1024x600x16 as default hardware resolution.  Changes:  - Implement fb_check_var and fb_set_par callbacks - Remove __maybe_unused decorator in function being used (sm712vga_setup) - Minor cleanup on initialization structs related with mode settings - Updated author copyright - Updated TODO file  Signed-off-by: Javier M.

Before the bug is fixed, remove the 2D acceleration!

This source code is originally from Silicon Motion Technology Corp, and maintained at http://dev.lemote.com/code/linux_loongson for YeeLoong netbook. I have done a lot of cleanups for it and merged it into my git repository at http://dev.lemote.com/code/rt4ls.  Thanks to Simon for testing it on a little-endian x86 platform.  Thanks to Olivier Croset <olivier.croset@actis-computer.com> for reporting the problem about __BIG_ENDIAN compiling problem and send a relative patch.  The suspend/resume and blank support are contributed by Jason from Silicon Motion Technology.
