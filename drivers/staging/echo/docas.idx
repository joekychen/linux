f | TODO | g | 173B |  | David Rowe | david@rowetel.com | 1253041336 |  | Staging: echo: top bit patch  This patch removes the need for the bit_operations.h include file which can now be deleted.  It also contains some minor corrections to comments (typos and alignment of ASCII formulas).  I have also removed some #if lines that were not necessary.  I have tested the patch using a unit test module that runs in kernel mode and have verified that the patched code gives identical results to the previous version using a 8000 sample input sequence.  Let me know if you want this unit test, it runs automatically when the module is insmod-ed and outputs a go/no go result:  # insmod oslec.ko # dmesg [17191803.480000] oslec_test installed [17191803.480000] Testing OSLEC with 128 taps (16 ms tail) [17191803.496000] Oslec Unit Test PASSED! pass: 8000  fail: 0  Signed-off-by: David Rowe <david@rowetel.com> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
