f | Makefile | g | 113B |  | Mark Allyn | mark.a.allyn@intel.com | 1327960803 |  | staging: sep: SEP update  This is basically a rewrite so there isn't a nice easy to present way of providing this as a patch series. This patch is a pull of Mark's new driver into the upstream staging area. On top of that are a series of patches by Andy Shevchenko to make it build on the current tree, fix a few things and even get it passed sparse.  The new driver supports the kernel crypto layer, passes the coding style checks, passes human taste checks and has proper kernel-doc formatted comments.  I've then folded back in some later fixes it was missing that got applied to to the kernel tree.  This should be ready for more serious review with a view to migration from the staging tree shortly.
