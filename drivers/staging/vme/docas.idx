f | Makefile | g | 21B |  | Greg Kroah-Hartman | gregkh@linuxfoundation.org | 1335468898 |  | Staging: VME: move VME drivers out of staging  This moves the VME core, VME board drivers, and VME bridge drivers out of the drivers/staging/vme/ area to drivers/vme/.  The VME device drivers have not moved out yet due to some API questions they are still working through, that should happen soon, hopefully.
