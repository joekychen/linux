This approach can be valuable during automated testing or in situations, where other trigger methods are not applicable. For example no RTC or spare GPIOs. Last but not least we can allow user space applications to produce triggers.  IIO: TRIGGER: Apply review feedback by Greg Kroah-Hartman  Changes since v1:  Add sysfs documentation. Change license notice. Add module alias.

The frequency generator allows an external complex impedance to be excited with a known frequency.  The response signal from the impedance is sampled by the on-board ADC and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is processed by an on-chip DSP engine. The DFT algorithm returns a real (R) and imaginary (I) data-word at each output frequency.  Changes since V1:  Apply list review feedback: Consistently use poll_time_jiffies. Use be||le cpu endian helpers where applicable. Add various comments.  Changes since V2:  Fix KernelVersion tag in Documentation. Declare ad5933_default_pdata static. Fix typos.

f | ring.txt | g | 1.8K |  | Lars-Peter Clausen | lars@metafoo.de | 1324589890 |  | staging:iio: Drop {mark,unmark}_in_use callbacks  These callbacks are currently used by the individual buffer implementations to ensure that the request_update callback is not issued while the buffer is in use. But the core already provides sufficient measures to prevent this from happening in the first place. So it is safe to remove them.  There is one functional change due to this patch. Since the buffer is no longer marked as in use when the chrdev is opened, it is now possible to enable the buffer while it is opened. This did not work before, because mark_param_change did fail if the buffer was marked as in use.

E.g iio_device_register and iio_allocate_device. This patches renames instances of the later to the former. The patch also renames allocate to alloc as this seems to be the preferred form throughout the kernel.  In particular the following renames are performed by the patch: 	iio_put_device -> iio_device_put 	iio_allocate_device -> iio_device_alloc 	iio_free_device -> iio_device_free 	iio_get_trigger -> iio_trigger_get 	iio_put_trigger -> iio_trigger_put 	iio_allocate_trigger -> iio_trigger_alloc 	iio_free_trigger -> iio_trigger_free  The conversion was done with the following coccinelle patch with manual fixes to comments and documentation.  <smpl> @@ @@ -iio_put_device +iio_device_put @@ @@ -iio_allocate_device +iio_device_alloc @@ @@ -iio_free_device +iio_device_free @@ @@ -iio_get_trigger +iio_trigger_get @@ @@ -iio_put_trigger +iio_trigger_put @@ @@ -iio_allocate_trigger +iio_trigger_alloc @@ @@ -iio_free_trigger +iio_trigger_free </smpl>  Signed-off-by: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de> Acked-by: Jonathan Cameron <jic23@kernel.org> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
