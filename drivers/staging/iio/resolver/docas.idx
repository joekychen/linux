E.g iio_device_register and iio_allocate_device. This patches renames instances of the later to the former. The patch also renames allocate to alloc as this seems to be the preferred form throughout the kernel.  In particular the following renames are performed by the patch: 	iio_put_device -> iio_device_put 	iio_allocate_device -> iio_device_alloc 	iio_free_device -> iio_device_free 	iio_get_trigger -> iio_trigger_get 	iio_put_trigger -> iio_trigger_put 	iio_allocate_trigger -> iio_trigger_alloc 	iio_free_trigger -> iio_trigger_free  The conversion was done with the following coccinelle patch with manual fixes to comments and documentation.  <smpl> @@ @@ -iio_put_device +iio_device_put @@ @@ -iio_allocate_device +iio_device_alloc @@ @@ -iio_free_device +iio_device_free @@ @@ -iio_get_trigger +iio_trigger_get @@ @@ -iio_put_trigger +iio_trigger_put @@ @@ -iio_allocate_trigger +iio_trigger_alloc @@ @@ -iio_free_trigger +iio_trigger_free </smpl>  Signed-off-by: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de> Acked-by: Jonathan Cameron <jic23@kernel.org> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

Conversion of ads1210 to use array registration triggered build failures that highlighted all was not well.
