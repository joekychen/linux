f | Makefile | g | 99B |  | Michael Hennerich | michael.hennerich@analog.com | 1314131822 |  | iio: impedance-analyzer: New driver for AD5933/4 Impedance Converter, Network Analyzer  The AD5933 is a high precision impedance converter system solution that combines an on-board frequency generator with a 12-bit, 1 MSPS, analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The frequency generator allows an external complex impedance to be excited with a known frequency.  The response signal from the impedance is sampled by the on-board ADC and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is processed by an on-chip DSP engine. The DFT algorithm returns a real (R) and imaginary (I) data-word at each output frequency.  Changes since V1:  Apply list review feedback: Consistently use poll_time_jiffies. Use be||le cpu endian helpers where applicable. Add various comments.  Changes since V2:  Fix KernelVersion tag in Documentation. Declare ad5933_default_pdata static. Fix typos.
