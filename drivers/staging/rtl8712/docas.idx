This broke complete operation of the driver whenever AP mode was enabled. This fixes https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/27996.  The configuration parameter R8712_AP is misleading as the driver cannot function as an AP without a heavily hacked version of hostapd. Thus, it makes sense to remove the parameter; however the code and data configured for the option is left in.

A total of 9 semaphores were removed in this process.  One other change was to remove some inline semaphore routines that were unused.  In addition, several cases had the following structure:  down() if () {    ... } up()  The locking overhead was reduced by moving the up/down inside the if block.
