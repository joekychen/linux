It includes its own copy of the ieee80211 stack, but it is compiled into the driver to prevend duplicate symbol issues.  This version comes from Ralink with no authorship, but it is based on an old version of the rtl8180 driver from Andrea Merello.  It was hacked up a bit to get it to build properly within the kernel tree and to properly handle the merged wireless stack within the driver.
