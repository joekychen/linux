f | Kconfig | g | 289B |  | Randy Dunlap | rdunlap@xenotime.net | 1321657254 |  | staging: fix more ET131X build errors  ET131X is a network device, so it should depend on NETDEVICES.  (This part won't be needed when the driver moves to drivers/net/.)  It also uses PHYLIB interfaces, so it should select PHYLIB.
