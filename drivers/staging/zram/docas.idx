It's been in -next for a long time, and it gets rid of the (no longer used) second argument to k[un]map_atomic().  Fix up a few trivial conflicts in various drivers, and do an "evil merge" to catch some new uses that have come in since Cong's tree.  * 'kmap_atomic' of git://github.com/congwang/linux: (59 commits)   feature-removal-schedule.txt: schedule the deprecated form of kmap_atomic() for removal   highmem: kill all __kmap_atomic() [swarren@nvidia.com: highmem: Fix ARM build break due to __kmap_atomic rename]   drbd: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   zcache: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   gma500: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   dm: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   tomoyo: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   sunrpc: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   rds: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   net: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   mm: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   lib: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   power: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   kdb: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   udf: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   ubifs: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   squashfs: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   reiserfs: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   ocfs2: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   ntfs: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()   ...

This was renamed from num_devices to zram_num_devices (without updating the documentation!) since num_devices was declared as a non-static global variable, polluting the global namespace. Now, we declare it as a static variable and revert back the name change.  The documentation (zram.txt) already mentions num_devices as the module parameter name.

X86 dependency added to zsmalloc and dependent drivers zcache and zram.  This X86 only requirement is not ideal.  Working to find portable functions for __flush_tlb_one and set_pte.
