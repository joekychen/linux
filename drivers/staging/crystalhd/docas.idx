f | crystalhd_fw_if.h | s | 13K | 309 | Arvydas Sidorenko | asido4@gmail.com | 1315839085 |  | drivers/staging/crystalhd/: Fix a coding style issues  crystalhd_fw_if.h: indentation fix (spaces to tabs) The rest are brackets.  NOTE: there are quite some 80 character warnings, but they look in place, comments mostly on the right next to the constants and stuff like that. I haven't touched them, since this rule is 'going away', but in case you would like it to be fixed, let me know.  I'm sending 2 patches, but it they aren't connected in any way, so doesn't matter the apply order. It's just a cleanup.  P.S sorry for the first lame patches a couple of days ago  Signed-off-by: Arvydas Sidorenko <asido4@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

f | Kconfig | g | 165B |  | Jarod Wilson | jarod@redhat.com | 1267663354 |  | staging: add Broadcom Crystal HD driver  This patch supersedes the earlier ones sent by Manu Abraham to add the Broadcom Crystal HD driver to the staging tree, per discussion with him about it. I've been working with Broadcom's Naren Sankar on this driver for a number of months, and had already talked Naren about submitting this on Broadcom's behalf, didn't expect anyone else to jump on submitting it as quickly as Manu did. ;)  This version is a one-shot deal, incorporating the original driver, Manu's coding style clean-ups, udev device creation support from Edgar 'gimli' Hucek, and a number of other small tweaks from myself and Scott Davilla, the other individual who has been working closely on this code with Naren and I.  I've tested this iteration of the code lightly on a mini pci-e board in a ThinkPad T61p running x86_64 Fedora 12, with the expected results, and will test further on other systems with other variants of the card (I have three varieties of this device currently in hand). Scott has also tested on assorted primarily i686 varieties of Ubuntu, and Naren has tested with both Fedora and Ubuntu, iirc.  Note: only the 70012 is currently supported by this driver, 70015 support will follow later. Also note that Blu-Ray support isn't enabled (at the firmware level), due to misc fun related to the BD encryption scheme, DRM, etc. :\  I *do* have a git tree containing the driver, lib, gst plugin and firmware that I'm working from at the moment[*], as there are inter- dependencies between the driver and lib, and the driver can be used with kernels going a ways back (I've only tested back to 2.6.18 as it exists in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5). I'm exporting from there, into a linux-next tree, then generating patches from there. The goal is to feed everything upstream as quickly as possible, but there are users who want this code for earlier kernels too...  The firmware will be submitted for inclusion in dwmw2's linux-firmware tree once there is a suitable redistribution-no-modification type of license on it (I believe Naren is working with Broadcom legal to get that in place).
