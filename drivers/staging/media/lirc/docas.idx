This patch removes it from being used in the driver and uses dev_err() instead  Cc: Jarod Wilson <jarod@wilsonet.com> Cc: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org> Cc: Jesper Juhl <jj@chaosbits.net> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

Better to distinguish it, by putting the media drivers at a separate staging directory.
