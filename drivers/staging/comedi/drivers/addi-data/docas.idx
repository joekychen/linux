Change the return type from int to void  All the detach functions, except for the comedi usb drivers, simply return success (0). Plus, the return code is never checked in the comedi core.  The comedi usb drivers do return error codes but the conditions can never happen.  The first check is:  	if (!dev) 		return -EFAULT;  This checks that the passed comedi_device pointer is valid. The detach function itself is called using this pointer so it MUST always be valid or there is a bug in the core:  	if (dev->driver) 		dev->driver->detach(dev);  And the second check:  	usb = dev->private; 	if (!usb) 		return -EFAULT;  The dev->private pointer is setup in the attach function to point to the probed usb device. This value could be NULL if the attach fails. But, since the comedi core is going to unload the driver anyway and does not check for errors there is no gain by returning one.  After removing these checks from the comedi usb drivers the detach functions required a bit of cleanup.  2. Remove all the printk noise in the detach functions  All of the printk output is really just noise. The user did a rmmod to unload the driver, we really don't need to tell them about it.  Also, some of the messages are output using:  	dev_dbg(dev->hw_dev, ... or 	dev_info(dev->hw_dev, ...  Unfortunately the hw_dev value is only used by drivers that are doing DMA. For most drivers this variable is going to be NULL so the output is not going to work as expected.  3. Refactor a couple static 'free_resource' functions into the detach    functions.  The 'free_resource' function is only being called by the detach and it makes more sense to just absorb the code.  4. Remove a couple unnecessary braces for single statements.  5. Remove unnecessary comments.  Most of the comedi drivers appear to be based on the comedi skel driver and have the comments from that driver included. These comments make sense in the skel driver for reference but they don't need to be in any of the actual drivers.  6. Remove all the extra whitespace.  It's not needed to make the functions any more readable.  7. Remove the now unused 'attached_successfully' variable in the    cb_pcimdda driver.  This variable was only used to conditionally output some driver noise during the detach. Since all the printk's have been removed this variable is no longer necessary.

Unfortunately, they currently write the parameters from the EEPROM back to the shared, read-only board data!  The problem has been masked during compilation by type-casting away the const-ness of the data.  This patch changes the code to use an area in the private data for the board instance to hold the parameters read from EEPROM (after initializing the parameters from the static board data).  It also changes the type-casts to the read-only data to preserve the const qualifier.  Signed-off-by: Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
