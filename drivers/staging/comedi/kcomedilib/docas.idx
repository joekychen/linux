f | Makefile | g | 86B |  | Alexander Kurz | linux@kbdbabel.org | 1274217792 |  | Staging: comedi: new Kconfig and Makefiles, drivers grouped by bustype.  PC/104-drivers went into ISA, PC/104+ went into PCI, Drivers without a bustype went into "misc". In doubt drivers supporting both ISA/PCI went into PCI. Drivers without any detailed hardware info went into ISA, e.g. fl512.c Some NI drivers are used by other NI drivers from different bustypes are grouped seperately in NI_COMMON.
