f | Makefile.am | g | 336B |  | matt mooney | mfm@muteddisk.com | 1310158876 |  | staging: usbip: userspace: fix header installation bug  A bug that I created due to using simply expanding variables in the makefiles. Although only unexpanded paths are at issue here, I decided to use recursively expanding variables on all of the parameterized values.

Also modify include guards for consistency.  Signed-off-by: matt mooney <mfm@muteddisk.com> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

This doesn't happen with the usbip virtual hci module, but another module wanting to interface with this user space code could cause a seg-fault by sending data without newlines.

So, instead, change all of the output from the library to debug only, and allow the programs to decide what to tell the user. This also changes the messages to use the same form, which makes understanding them easier.  Signed-off-by: matt mooney <mfm@muteddisk.com> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
