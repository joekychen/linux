The Epson s1d13806 is already supported by 2.6.12 kernel, and its driver is placed as drivers/video/s1d13xxxfb.c.  For the m32r, a header file include/asm-m32r/s1d13806.h was prepared for several m32r target platforms.  It was originally generated by an Epson tool S1D13806CFG.EXE, and modified manually for the m32r platforms.
