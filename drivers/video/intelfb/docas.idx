All of them keep redefining the same FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC macro over and over again, so move it to linux/fb.h and clean up those duplicate defines.

f | intelfbhw.h | s | 18K | 531 | Krzysztof Helt | krzysztof.h1@wp.pl | 1260976805 |  | intelfb: fix setting of active pipe with LVDS displays  The intelfb driver sets color map depending on currently active pipe. However, if an LVDS display is attached (like in laptop) the active pipe variable is never set.  The default value is PIPE_A and can be wrong.  Set up the pipe variable during driver initialization after hardware state was read.  Also, the detection of the active display (and hence the pipe) is wrong. The pipes are assigned to so called planes.  Both pipes are always enabled on my laptop but only one plane is enabled (the plane A for the CRT or the plane B for the LVDS).  Change active pipe detection code to take into account a status of the plane assigned to each pipe.  The problem is visible in the 8 bpp mode if colors above 15 are used.  The first 16 color entries are displayed correctly.
