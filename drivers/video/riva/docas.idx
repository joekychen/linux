f | rivafb-i2c.c | s | 3.6K | 135 | Jean Delvare | khali@linux-fr.org | 1289857238 |  | i2c: Delete unused adapter IDs  Delete unused I2C adapter IDs. Special cases are:  * I2C_HW_B_RIVA was still set in driver rivafb, however no other   driver is ever looking for this value, so we can safely remove it. * I2C_HW_B_HDPVR is used in staging driver lirc_zilog, however no   adapter ID is ever set to this value, so the code in question never   runs. As the code additionally expects that I2C_HW_B_HDPVR may not   be defined, we can delete it now and let the lirc_zilog driver   maintainer rewrite this piece of code.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
