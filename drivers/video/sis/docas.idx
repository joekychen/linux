Changes include:  - Added support for XGI V3XT, V5, V8, Z7 chipsets, including POSTing of   all of these chipsets.  - Added support for latest SiS chipsets (761).  - Added support for SiS76x memory "hybrid" mode.  - Added support for new LCD resolutions (eg 1280x854, 856x480).  - Fixed support for 320x240 STN panels (for embedded devices).  - Fixed many HDTV modes (525p, 750p, 1080i).  - Fixed PCI config register reading/writing to use proper kernel   functions for this purpose.  - Fixed PCI ROM handling to use the kernel's proper functions.  - Removed lots of "typedef"s.  - Removed lots of code which was for X.org/XFree86 only.  - Fixed coding style in many places.  - Removed lots of 2.4 cruft.  - Reduced stack size by unifying two previously separate structs into   one.  - Added new hooks for memory allocation (for DRM).  Now the driver can   truly handle multiple cards, including memory management.  - Fixed numerous minor bugs.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Winischhofer <thomas@winischhofer.net> Cc: "Antonino A.
