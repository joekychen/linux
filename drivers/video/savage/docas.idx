f | savagefb.h | s | 10K | 340 | John Stanley | jpsinthemix@verizon.net | 1312657360 |  | savagedb: Fix typo causing regression in savage4 series video chip detection  Two additional savage4 variants were added, but the S3_SAVAGE4_SERIES macro was incompletely modified, resulting in a false positive detection of a savage4 card regardless of which savage card is actually present.  For non-savage4 series cards, such as a Savage/IX-MV card, this results in garbled video and/or a hard-hang at boot time.  Fix this by changing an '||||' to an '&&' in the S3_SAVAGE4_SERIES macro.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
