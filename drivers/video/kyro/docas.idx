The include of <asm/uaccess.h> is removed if the driver does not use it.

This exposes some issues where drivers where reading a word or a dword for the revision number, and adding useless error-handling around the read. Some drivers even just read it for no purpose of all.  In devices where the revision ID is being copied over and used in what appears to be the equivalent of hotpath, I have left the copy code and the cached copy as not to influence the driver's performance.  Compile tested with make all{yes,mod}config on x86_64 and i386.
