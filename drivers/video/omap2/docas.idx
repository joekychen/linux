The escape clock/LP clock is calculated as:  LP Clock(Hz) = DSI_FCLK(Hz) / lp_clk_div  Since we are calculating the time period of LP clock, the LP clock divider should be multiplied with the time period of DSI_FCLK.  Calculating incorrect value of txclkesc results in incorrect calculation of LP interleaving parameters, it also creates a possibility of a divide by zero error.

However, there usually is very little SRAM available, thus limiting its use, and no board supported by the kernel currently uses it.  This patch removes the use of SRAM as video ram for the omapdss driver to simplify memory handling.  Signed-off-by: Tomi Valkeinen <tomi.valkeinen@ti.com> Acked-by: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>

Many places in code expect the execution to stop, and this causes compiler warnings about uninitialized variables and returning from a non-void function without a return value.  This patch fixes the warnings by initializing the variables and returning properly after BUG() lines. However, the behaviour is still undefined after the BUG, but this is the choice the user makes when using CONFIG_BUG=n.  Signed-off-by: Tomi Valkeinen <tomi.valkeinen@ti.com>
