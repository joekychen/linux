Enough is enough - remove the problem line that was added.  If it upsets someone they've had two years to deal with it and at the very least it'll rattle their cage and wake them up.

Also strengthen the disrecommendation of the protocol mangling while we're at it.  In the case of regmap-i2c we remove the requirement for mangling as I2C_M_NOSTART is the only mangling feature which is being used.
