Tackle this one head on  - Make the kbd_table private so we can run down all direct users - Hoick the relevant ioctl handlers into the keyboard layer - Lock them with the keyboard lock so they don't change mid keypress - Add helpers for things like console stop/start so we isolate the poking   around properly - Tweak the braille console so it still builds  There are a couple of FIXME locking cases left for ioctls that are so hideous they should be addressed in a later patch. After this patch the kbd_table is private and all the keyboard jiggery pokery is in one place.  This update fixes speakup and also a memory leak in the original.

This is meant to be used by blind people e.g.  on boot failures or when / cannot be mounted etc and thus the userland screen readers can not work.
