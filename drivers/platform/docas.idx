The community has been maintaining x86 vendor-specific platform specific drivers under /drivers/misc/ for a few years. The oldest ones started life under drivers/acpi. They moved out of drivers/acpi/ because they don't actually implement the ACPI specification, but either simply use ACPI, or implement vendor-specific ACPI extensions.  In the future we anticipate... drivers/misc/ will go away. other architectures will create drivers/platform/<arch>  Signed-off-by: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>
