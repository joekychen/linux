Note that we prefix the IDs with "MAC," in order to prevent the generic drivers from matching. This is done on purpose as we only want drivers specifically tested/designed to operate on powermacs to match.  This removes the special case we had for the AMS driver, and updates the driver's match table instead.  Signed-off-by: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
