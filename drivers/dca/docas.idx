f | Makefile | g | 62B |  | Shannon Nelson | shannon.nelson@intel.com | 1192552989 |  | DCA: Add Direct Cache Access driver  Direct Cache Access (DCA) is a method for warming the CPU cache before data is used, with the intent of lessening the impact of cache misses.  This patch adds a manager and interface for matching up client requests for DCA services with devices that offer DCA services.  In order to use DCA, a module must do bus writes with the appropriate tag bits set to trigger a cache read for a specific CPU.  However, different CPUs and chipsets can require different sets of tag bits, and the methods for determining the correct bits may be simple hardcoding or may be a hardware specific magic incantation.  This interface is a way for DCA clients to find the correct tag bits for the targeted CPU without needing to know the specifics.
