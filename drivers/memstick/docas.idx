But it won't be once we clean up its presence from device.h Call out the real users of it in advance.  Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>
f | Makefile | g | 178B |  | matt mooney | mfm@muteddisk.com | 1300367134 |  | memstick: change to new flag variable  The EXTRA_CFLAGS assignment in memstick/Makefile was not accomplishing anything because this flag only has effect on sources at the same level as the makefile (i.e., per directory). Since both core/ and host/ rely on MEMSTICK_DEBUG, the subdir-ccflags-y variant seems to be the appropriate choice.
