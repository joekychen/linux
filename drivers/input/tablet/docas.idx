Fix annoying conflict in drivers/input/tablet/wacom_wac.c that I think implies that the input layer device naming is broken, but let's see.

In wacom_query_tablet_data(), only invoke the set report that requests tablets to send Wacom Touch packets for Finger interfaces.  Mostly, this is to make code intent clear.

Added bonus is that it removes some unneeded kernel log messages about drivers loading and/or unloading.
