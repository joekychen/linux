f | Makefile | g | 105B |  | Timur Tabi | timur@freescale.com | 1310102487 |  | drivers/virt: introduce Freescale hypervisor management driver  Add the drivers/virt directory, which houses drivers that support virtualization environments, and add the Freescale hypervisor management driver.  The Freescale hypervisor management driver provides several services to drivers and applications related to the Freescale hypervisor:  1. An ioctl interface for querying and managing partitions  2. A file interface to reading incoming doorbells  3. An interrupt handler for shutting down the partition upon receiving the    shutdown doorbell from a manager partition  4. A kernel interface for receiving callbacks when a managed partition    shuts down.
