On i386 and x86_64 most idle handlers (e.g.     poll, mwait, halt, etc.) don't benefit from an infrastructure that     supports multiple states, so I think using a more general case idle     handler selection mechanism would be cleaner.

I call it the 'menu' governor because it     considers the full list of idle states before each entry.      I've kept the implementation fairly simple.  It attempts to guess the     next residency time and then chooses a state that would meet at least     the break-even point between power savings and entry cost.  To this end,     it selects the deepest idle state that satisfies the following     constraints:          1. If the idle time elapsed since bus master activity was detected             is below a threshold (currently 20 ms), then limit the selection             to C2-type or above.          2. Do not choose a state with a break-even residency that exceeds             the expected time remaining until the next timer interrupt.          3. Do not choose a state with a break-even residency that exceeds             the elapsed time between the last pair of break events,             excluding timer interrupts.      This governor has an advantage over "ladder" governor because it     proactively checks how much time remains until the next timer interrupt     using the tick infrastructure.  Also, it handles device interrupt     activity more intelligently by not including timer interrupts in break     event calculations.  Finally, it doesn't make policy decisions using the     number of state entries, which can have variable residency times (NO_HZ     makes these potentially very large), and instead only considers sleep     time deltas.      The menu governor can be selected during runtime using the cpuidle sysfs     interface like so:     "echo "menu" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/current_governor"      Signed-off-by: Adam Belay <abelay@novell.com>     Signed-off-by: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>  commit a4bec7e65aa3b7488b879d971651cc99a6c410fe Author: Adam Belay <abelay@novell.com> Date:   Sat Mar 24 03:47:03 2007 -0400      cpuidle: export time until next timer interrupt using NO_HZ      Expose information about the time remaining until the next     timer interrupt expires by utilizing the dynticks infrastructure.

This is due to enter_idle(), exit_idle() races.  Make     cpuidle_idle_call() confirm to this when there is no pm_idle_old.      Also, cpuidle look at the return values of attch_driver() and set     current_driver to NULL if attach fails on all CPUs.

A cpuidle driver can support multiple idle states based on parameters like     varying power consumption, wakeup latency, etc (ACPI C-states for example).     A cpuidle governor can be usage model specific (laptop, server,     laptop on battery etc).     Main advantage of the infrastructure being, it allows independent development     of drivers and governors and allows for better CPU power management.      A huge thanks to Adam Belay and Shaohua Li who were part of this mini-project     since its beginning and are greatly responsible for this patchset.      This patch:      Core cpuidle infrastructure.     Introduces a new abstraction layer for cpuidle:     * which manages drivers that can support multiple idles states. Drivers       can be generic or particular to specific hardware/platform     * allows pluging in multiple policy governors that can take idle state policy       decision     * The core also has a set of sysfs interfaces with which administrato can know       about supported drivers and governors and switch them at run time.

One reason is BIOS might configure them incorrectly.  To help developers root cause it quickly, the patch adds a new sysfs entry, so developers could disable specific C state manually.  In addition, C state might have much impact on performance tuning, as it takes much time to enter/exit C states, which might delay interrupt processing.  With the new debug option, developers could check if a deep C state could impact performance and how much impact it could cause.  Also add this option in Documentation/cpuidle/sysfs.txt.

After all sysdev classes are ported to regular driver core entities, the sysdev implementation will be entirely removed from the kernel.  Userspace relies on events and generic sysfs subsystem infrastructure from sysdev devices, which are made available with this conversion.
