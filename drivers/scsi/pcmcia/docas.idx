The patch below presents a simple SCSI host lock push-down as an equivalent transformation.  No locking or other behavior should change with this patch.  All existing bugs and locking orders are preserved.  Additionally, add one parameter to queuecommand, 	struct Scsi_Host * and remove one parameter from queuecommand, 	void (*done)(struct scsi_cmnd *)  Scsi_Host* is a convenient pointer that most host drivers need anyway, and 'done' is redundant to struct scsi_cmnd->scsi_done.  Minimal code disturbance was attempted with this change.  Most drivers needed only two one-line modifications for their host lock push-down.
