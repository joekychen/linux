The UFS host controller driver includes host controller initialization method.  The Initialization process involves following steps:  - Initiate UFS Host Controller initialization process by writing    to Host controller enable register  - Configure UFS Host controller registers with host memory space    datastructure offsets.  - Unipro link startup procedure  - Check for connected device  - Configure UFS host controller to process requests  - Enable required interrupts  - Configure interrupt aggregation  [jejb: fix warnings in 32 bit compile] Signed-off-by: Santosh Yaraganavi <santoshsy@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Vinayak Holikatti <vinholikatti@gmail.com> Reviewed-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@linaro.org> Reviewed-by: Vishak G <vishak.g@samsung.com> Reviewed-by: Girish K S <girish.shivananjappa@linaro.org> Reviewed-by: Namjae Jeon <linkinjeon@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: James Bottomley <JBottomley@Parallels.com>
