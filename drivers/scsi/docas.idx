The reason is that if ncr_attach() returns NULL (signalling failure) that NULL is passed by the goto failed straight into ncr_detach() which oopses.  The fix is just to return -ENODEV in this case.

After increasing the CAN_QUEUE to 510 in pm8001 we discovered some performance degredation from time to time. We needed to increase the MPI queue to compensate and ensure we never hit that limit. We also needed to double the margin to support event and administrivial commands that take from the pool resulting in an occasional largely unproductive command completion with soft error to the caller when the command pool is overloaded temporarily.

f | sd.c | s | 78K | 2558 | Alan Stern | stern@rowland.harvard.edu | 1340427931 |  | SCSI & usb-storage: add try_rc_10_first flag  Several bug reports have been received recently for USB mass-storage devices that don't handle READ CAPACITY(16) commands properly.  They report bogus sizes, in some cases becoming unusable as a result.  The bugs were triggered by commit 09b6b51b0b6c1b9bb61815baf205e4d74c89ff04 (SCSI & usb-storage: add flags for VPD pages and REPORT LUNS), which caused usb-storage to stop overriding the SCSI level reported by devices.  By default, the sd driver will try READ CAPACITY(16) first for any device whose level is above SCSI_SPC_2.  It seems likely that any device large enough to require the use of READ CAPACITY(16) (i.e., 2 TB or more) would be able to handle READ CAPACITY(10) commands properly.  Indeed, I don't know of any devices that don't handle READ CAPACITY(10) properly.  Therefore this patch (as1559) adds a new flag telling the sd driver to try READ CAPACITY(10) before READ CAPACITY(16), and sets this flag for every USB mass-storage device.  If a device really is larger than 2 TB, sd will fall back to READ CAPACITY(16) just as it used to.  This fixes Bugzilla #43391.

f | bvme6000_scsi.c | s | 3.3K | 116 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

As part of mapping the application's memory, a buffer to hold page pointers is allocated and the count of mapped pages is stored in field do_dio.  A non-zero do_dio marks that direct I/O is in use.  But do_dio is only 1 byte in size.  Mapping 256 4k pages overflows do_dio and causes it to be set to 0, like direct I/O option was not used.  When the I/O completes, the buffer to hold the page pointers is not freed, and the page counts of the mapped pages are not reduced. Every I/O of this size then leaks memory.  The size of do_dio needs to be increased to prevent it wrapping around.

The two are paired using a (void * priv) member of the fcoe_ctlr_device.

Petersen | martin.petersen@oracle.com | 1329668092 |  | [SCSI] Handle disk devices which can not process medium access commands  We have experienced several devices which fail in a fashion we do not currently handle gracefully in SCSI. After a failure these devices will respond to the SCSI primary command set (INQUIRY, TEST UNIT READY, etc.) but any command accessing the storage medium will time out.  The following patch adds an callback that can be used by upper level drivers to inspect the results of an error handling command. This in turn has been used to implement additional checking in the SCSI disk driver.  If a medium access command fails twice but TEST UNIT READY succeeds both times in the subsequent error handling we will offline the device. The maximum number of failed commands required to take a device offline can be tweaked in sysfs.  Also add a new error flag to scsi_debug which allows this scenario to be easily reproduced.

Write any changes between the default and the data we read  	Which is great as for some paths we've no idea what was in before, so each boot won't write it all back, won't checksum but will repeat the bug  Also it can still sleep for a second with IRQ off, and there is some dubious looking error path locking marked FIXME in case anyone feels inspired to work on it.

f | lasi700.c | s | 4.7K | 159 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

The memory allocation is different for FCFs. I didn't want to impact libfcoe's fcoe_fcf processing, so this patch creates fcoe_fcf_device instances for each discovered fcoe_fcf. The two are paired using a (void * priv) member of the fcoe_ctlr_device. This allows libfcoe to continue maintaining its list of fcoe_fcf instances and simply attaches and detaches them from existing or new fcoe_fcf_device instances.

This means that if SCSI reports the host as busy in the queue congestion control it can result in an unfair starvation situation in dm-mp if there are multiple multipath devices on the same host.  For example: http://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2012-May/msg00123.html  The fix for this is to report only the sdev busy state (and ignore the host busy state) in the block congestion control call back. The host is still congested, but the SCSI subsystem will sort out the congestion in a fair way because it knows the relation between the queues and the host.

Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

Dial back this to 30 seconds with no heartbeat change, and also snoop the ioctl path and if a firmware flash command is detected, dial it back further to 4 minutes until the firmware flash command completes.  The reason for this is that during the firmware flash operation, the controller apparently doesn't update the heartbeat register as frequently as it is supposed to, and we can get a false positive.

But now they are actually 20 bit. So the fix is simplicity itself.  I've tested with 300 devices and all user-mode utils work just fine. I have also mechanically added 10,000 to the ida (so devices are /dev/osd10000, /dev/osd10001 ...) and was able to mkfs an exofs filesystem and access osds from user-mode.  All the open-osd user-mode code uses the same library to access devices through their symbolic names in /dev/osdX so I'd say it's pretty safe. (Well tested)  This patch is very important because some of the systems that will be deploying the 3.2 pnfs-objects code are larger than 64 OSDs and will stop to work properly when reaching that number.

f | Kconfig | g | 65K |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1337818326 |  | Merge branch 'delete-mca' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulg/linux  Pull the MCA deletion branch from Paul Gortmaker:  "It was good that we could support MCA machines back in the day, but   realistically, nobody is using them anymore.  They were mostly limited   to 386-sx 16MHz CPU and some 486 class machines and never more than   64MB of RAM.  Even the enthusiast hobbyist community seems to have   dried up close to ten years ago, based on what you can find searching   various websites dedicated to the relatively short lived hardware.    So lets remove the support relating to CONFIG_MCA.  There is no point   carrying this forward, wasting cycles doing routine maintenance on it;   wasting allyesconfig build time on validating it, wasting I/O on git   grep'ping over it, and so on."  Let's see if anybody screams.  It generally has compiled, and James Bottomley pointed out that there was a MCA extension from NCR that allowed for up to 4GB of memory and PPro-class machines.  So in *theory* there may be users out there.  But even James (technically listed as a maintainer) doesn't actually have a system, and while Alan Cox claims to have a machine in his cellar that he offered to anybody who wants to take it off his hands, he didn't argue for keeping MCA support either.  So we could bring it back.  But somebody had better speak up and talk about how they have actually been using said MCA hardware with modern kernels for us to do that.  And David already took the patch to delete all the networking driver code (commit a5e371f61ad3: "drivers/net: delete all code/drivers depending on CONFIG_MCA").  * 'delete-mca' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulg/linux:   MCA: delete all remaining traces of microchannel bus support.   scsi: delete the MCA specific drivers and driver code   serial: delete the MCA specific 8250 support.   arm: remove ability to select CONFIG_MCA

f | NCR_D700.c | s | 10K | 353 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

Apparently debian still uses it so fix it and backport to stable before removing it in 3.6.  The breakage is caused because the function template in include/scsi/scsi_scan.h is defined to be a nop unless SCSI is built in.

Commit a692b0ee made the assumption that all the phy ids an lldd registers to libsas are unique.  However, in the "multi-chip" case mvsas does a rather annoying duplication of phy ids in the array passed to libsas.  So, for example, chip0 has phy0-3 at ha phy index 0-3 and chip1 has its phy0-3 at ha phy index 4-7.  The more natural model would be to create a scsi_host (and sas_ha) per chip (controller), but for now revert the naming fix which unfortunately means dealing with unpredictable end-device names for a bit longer.

f | raid_class.c | s | 7.7K | 261 | James Bottomley | James.Bottomley@suse.de | 1267631226 |  | [SCSI] raid_attrs: fix dependency problems  RAID attributes uses scsi_is_sdev_device() to gate some SCSI specific checking code.  This causes two problems.  Firstly if SCSI == n just defining scsi_is_sdev_device() to return false might not be enough to prevent gcc from emitting the code (and thus referring to undefined symbols), so this needs surrounding with an ifdef.  Secondly, using scsi_is_sdev_device() when SCSI is either y or m gives a subtle problem in the m case: raid_attrs must also be m to use the symbol. Do the usual Kconfig jiggery-pokery to fix this.

f | sun3x_esp.c | s | 7.2K | 261 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.
