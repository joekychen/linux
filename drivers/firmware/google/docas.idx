f | Makefile | g | 86B |  | Mike Waychison | mikew@google.com | 1304125774 |  | driver: Google Memory Console  This patch introduces the 'memconsole' driver.  Our firmware gives us access to an in-memory log of the firmware's output.   This gives us visibility in a data-center of headless machines as to what the firmware is doing.  The memory console is found by the driver by finding a header block in the EBDA.  The buffer is then copied out, and is exported to userland in the file /sys/firmware/log.

That's what GOOGLE_SMI does.  Make it enable EFI also.  Fixes this kconfig dependency warning:  warning: (GOOGLE_SMI) selects EFI_VARS which has unmet direct dependencies (EFI)  Signed-off-by: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com> Acked-by: Mike Waychison <mikew@google.com> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
