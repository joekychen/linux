It separates the handling of Logite from the generic lgff driver and adds additional features specific for the Logitech wheels, namely  - Native mode support for Driving Force GT, Driving Force Pro, G25 and G27 wheels Every Logitech wheel reports itself as generic Logitech Driving Force wheel (VID 046d, PID c294). This is done to ensu wheel will work on every USB HID-aware system even when no Logitech driver is available. It however limits the capabilit wheel - range is limited to 200 degrees, G25/G27 don't report the clutch pedal and there is only one combined axis for t brake. The switch to native mode is done via hardware-specific command which is different for each wheel. When the wheel receives such command, it simulates reconnect and reports to the OS with its actual PID.  - Adjustable wheel range DFGT, DFP, G25 and G27 have variable range of the steering wheel. The range is limited by applying a maximum constant when the wheel is turned beyond the allowed range. The limit as also set by a hardware-specific command. There is a comm command for DFGT, G25 and G27 and another one for DFP. It is probably possible to use the DFP command to limit the range other Logitech wheels too, but this is not supported by the official Logitech driver for Windows.  The patch adds a sysfs interface which allows for the range to be set from userspace.  - Fixed autocentering command All Logitech wheels support FF_AUTOCENTER effect. The original implementation in the lgff driver didn't work well with patch fixes it. According to USB communication sniffs the Formula Force EX (pretty much rebranded original Driving Force accept the generic autocentering command, this issue is also addressed by the patch  There are still some features this patch doesn't cover, but since some of them will most likely require modifications of memless driver we have decided not to include them yet.  As first we decided to move the handling of Logitech wheels from hid-lgff driver to hid-lg4ff driver (originally used fo At also adds PID of Logitech Driving Force GT.
