f | ngene-cards.c | s | 16K | 470 | Mauro Carvalho Chehab | mchehab@redhat.com | 1327160725 |  | [media] drxk: Don't assume a default firmware name  Move the ngene/ddbridge firmware into their drivers.  There are two reasons for that: 	1) The firmware used there didn't work for a few devices I tested here (Terratec H5, H6 and H7); 	2) At least Terratec H7 doesn't seem to require a firmware for it to work.  After this change, if firmware is not specified, the driver will use a rom-based firmware (this seems to be the case for Terratec H7, although I need to better check the USB dumps to be sure about that).  In any case, the firmware seems to be optional, as the DRX-K driver don't return the firmware load error.  Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>

Better to distinguish it, by putting the media drivers at a separate staging directory. Newer staging drivers that include anything with "dvb*.h", "v4l2*.h" or "videodev2.h" should go to the drivers/staging/media tree.
