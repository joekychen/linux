f | Kconfig | g | 724B |  | Mauro Carvalho Chehab | mchehab@redhat.com | 1293617810 |  | [media] rc: rename the remaining things to rc_core  The Remote Controller subsystem is meant to be used not only by Infra Red but also for similar types of Remote Controllers. The core is not specific to Infra Red. As such, rename: 	- ir-core.h to rc-core.h 	- IR_CORE to RC_CORE 	- namespace inside rc-core.c/rc-core.h  To be consistent with the other changes.  No functional change on this patch.  Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>

By default, gmake(1) do not override command line setting, so this is likely to result in build failure or unexpected behavior.  Replace their usage by Kbuild's `{as,cc,ld}flags-y'.
