f | Makefile | g | 112B |  | Arnaud Lacombe | lacombar@gmail.com | 1315086659 |  | [media] drivers/media: do not use EXTRA_CFLAGS  Usage of these flags has been deprecated for nearly 4 years by:      commit f77bf01425b11947eeb3b5b54685212c302741b8     Author: Sam Ravnborg <sam@neptun.(none)>     Date:   Mon Oct 15 22:25:06 2007 +0200          kbuild: introduce ccflags-y, asflags-y and ldflags-y  Moreover, these flags (at least EXTRA_CFLAGS) have been documented for command line use. By default, gmake(1) do not override command line setting, so this is likely to result in build failure or unexpected behavior.  Replace their usage by Kbuild's `{as,cc,ld}flags-y'.

f | Kconfig | g | 488B |  | Trent Piepho | xyzzy@speakeasy.org | 1177699441 |  | V4L/DVB (5361): Dvb-pll: Fix Kconfig files and allow dvb-pll to be optional  A number of drivers selected DVB_PLL when they did not need it, and some that did need it did not select it.  The DVB_PLL option is given a name and help text, so that it will show up in the config menu.  DVB_PLL support can be turned on if an out-of-tree driver needs it.  The standard dvb fe customization support is added to dvb-pll.h.  Since all modules which select DVB_PLL do so unconditionally, it is not possible to turn dvb-pll off when an enabled module selects it, unlike most of the other frontend/tuner drivers.  This is because the users of dvb-pll have static references to dvb-pll symbols other than the attach function.  If these references are removed, then dvb-pll will be disablable as the other frontend/tuner drivers are.
