f | dvb_net.c | s | 41K | 1301 | Jonathan Nieder | jrnieder@gmail.com | 1325860846 |  | [media] DVB: dvb_net_init: return -errno on error  dvb_net_init unconditionally returns 0.  Callers such as videobuf_dvb_register_frontend examine dvbnet->dvbdev instead of the return value to tell whether the operation succeeded.  If it has been set to a valid pointer, success; if it was left equal to NULL, failure.  Alas, there is an edge case where that logic does not work as well: when network support has been compiled out (CONFIG_DVB_NET=n), we want dvb_net_init and related operations to behave as no-ops and always succeed, but there is no appropriate value to which to set dvb->dvbdev to indicate this.  Let dvb_net_init return a meaningful error code, as preparation for adapting callers to look at that instead.  The only immediate impact of this patch should be to make the few callers that already check for an error code from dvb_net_init behave a little more sensibly when it fails.

The underlying drivers (budget-av, budget-ci) do not implement proper locking and thus two transactions could (and do) interfere with on another.  This fixes the following problems seen by others and myself:   - sudden i/o errors when writing to the ci device which usually would    result in an undefined state of the hw and require a software restart   - errors about the CAM trying to send a buffer larger than the agreed size    usually also resulting in an undefined state of the hw  Due the to design of the DVB CA 50221 driver, implementing the locks in the underlying drivers would not be enough and still leave some race conditions, even though they were harder to trigger.

f | dmxdev.h | s | 2.5K | 95 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.
