By default, gmake(1) do not override command line setting, so this is likely to result in build failure or unexpected behavior.  Replace their usage by Kbuild's `{as,cc,ld}flags-y'.

This card has neither MPEG decoder nor conditional access module onboard. It transmits only compressed and possibly encrypted MPEG data over the PCI bus, so you need an external software decoder and a decrypter to watch TV on your computer.  This driver is originally developed by Tomoaki Ishikawa <tomy@users.sourceforge.jp> by reverse engineering.
