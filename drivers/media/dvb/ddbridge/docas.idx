f | Makefile | g | 337B |  | Mauro Carvalho Chehab | mchehab@redhat.com | 1320314343 |  | staging: Move media drivers to staging/media  In practice, it is being hard to distinguish when a patch should go to staging tree or to the media tree. Better to distinguish it, by putting the media drivers at a separate staging directory. Newer staging drivers that include anything with "dvb*.h", "v4l2*.h" or "videodev2.h" should go to the drivers/staging/media tree.
