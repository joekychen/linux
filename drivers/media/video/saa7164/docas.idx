That would lead into a compilation breakage, if this macro were used somewhere inside the driver.  Instead of fixing the macro, as originally proposed, let's just remove the dead code.

People tended to forget these, but the v4l2-ctl tool scans for these messages, and it also makes it easier to read the status output in the kernel log.  The cx18, ivtv and bttv drivers were changed since they no longer need to log these start/end messages.  In saa7164 two empty log_status functions were removed.  Also added a helper function to v4l2-ctrl.c that can be used as the vidioc_log_status callback if all you need to do is to log the current control values. This is now used by pwc and vivi.
