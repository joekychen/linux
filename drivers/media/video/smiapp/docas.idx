The driver exposes the sensor as three subdevs, pixel array, binner and scaler --- in case the device has a scaler.  Currently it relies on the board code for external clock handling. There is no fast way out of this dependency before the ISP drivers (omap3isp) among others will be able to export that clock through the clock framework instead.
