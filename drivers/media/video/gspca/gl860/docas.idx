f | gl860.h | s | 2.7K | 88 | Mauro Carvalho Chehab | mchehab@redhat.com | 1311799992 |  | [media] Stop using linux/version.h on most video drivers  All the modified drivers didn't have any version increment since Jan, 1 2011. Several of them didn't have any version increment for a long time, even having new features and important bug fixes happening.  As we're now filling the QUERYCAP version with the current Kernel Release, we don't need to maintain a per-driver version control anymore. So, let's just use the default.  In order to preserve the Kernel module version history, a KERNEL_VERSION() macro were added to all modified drivers, and the extraver number were incremented.  I opted to preserve the per-driver version control to a few pwc, pvrusb2, s2255, s5p-fimc and sh_vou.  A few drivers are still using the legacy way to handle ioctl's. So, we can't do such change on them, otherwise, they'll break. Those are: uvc, et61x251 and sn9c102.  The rationale is that the per-driver version control seems to be actively maintained on those.  Yet, I think that the better for them would be to just use the default version numbering, instead of doing that by themselves.  While here, removed a few uneeded include linux/version.h  Acked-by: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com> Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>
