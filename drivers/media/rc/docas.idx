Resource 0 has a length of only 1, and if you try to bypass the pnp_port_len check and use it anyway (with either a length of 1 or 2), the system in question's trackpad ceased to function.  The circa lirc 0.8.7 lirc_ite8709 driver used resource 2, but the value was (amusingly) changed to 0 by way of a patch from ITE themselves, so I don't know if there may be variants where 0 actually *is* correct, but at least in this case and in the original lirc_ite8709 driver author's case, it sure looks like 2 is the right value.  This fix should probably be applied to all stable kernels with the ite-cir driver, lest we nuke more people's trackpads.

To decode the function number, it shifts the bits right by 7 so that the function is in bits 7:1, masks with 0xFD (0b11111101), and does an 8 bit reverse so it ends up in bits 6:0. The mask should be 0xFE to correspond with bits 7:1 (0b11111110).  The old mask had the effect of dropping the MSB of the function number from bit 6, and leaving the LSB of the device number in bit 7.

The size of the event struct is 12 bytes, and space for 512 events is reserved in the kfifo (6144 bytes), however this is rounded down to 4096 bytes (the next power of 2) by __kfifo_alloc().  4096 bytes is not divisible by 12 therefore if the fifo fills up a third of a record will be written in the end of the kfifo by ir_raw_event_store() because the recsize of the fifo is 0 (it doesn't have records). When this is read by ir_raw_event_thread() a corrupted or partial record will be read, and in the case of a partial record the BUG_ON(retval != sizeof(ev)) gets hit too.  According to samples/kfifo/record-example.c struct kfifo_rec_ptr_1 can handle records of a length between 0 and 255 bytes, so change struct ir_raw_event_ctrl to use that instead of struct kfifo.
