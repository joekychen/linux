We may not yet have all the needed keymaps, in which case a wrong keymap may be used. This happened with Medion X10 OR2x remotes before the keymap for them was added, causing the ati_remote driver to select the Medion Digitainer keymap instead. Unfortunately, the Medion Digitainer keymap doesn't have the standard X10 up/down scancodes assigned to KEY_UP and KEY_DOWN keycodes, making wrongly assigned remotes mostly unusable.  Add the regular KEY_UP and KEY_DOWN scancodes to the Medion X10 Digitainer keymap, making any Medion remote mostly usable even when wrongly used with that keymap (standard buttons, such as up/down/left/right, 0-9, play/stop/pause, have the same scancode in all the X10 remotes).

However, one of those bytes is actually a checksum and therefore shouldn't be considered as part of the scancode.  Fix the driver to only use the actual data byte as a scancode and to check the checksum itself. Update the bundled keymaps accordingly.  Since ati_remote was only migrated to the rc subsystem for 3.2, the previous scancodes weren't emitted on any stable kernel.
