However, that was very confusing since if you play the audio from the device (e.g. through arecord -D ... || aplay) then no sound would play unless you had the radio device open at the same time, even though there is no need to do anything with that node.  On the other hand, the actual suspend/resume functions didn't do anything, which would fail if you *did* have the radio node open at that time.  So:  - remove autosuspend (bad idea in general for USB radio devices) - move the start/stop out of the open/release functions into the resume/suspend   functions.

The i2c specific part exists in radio-si470x-i2c.c file and the common part uses radio-si470x-common.c file. The '#if defined' is inserted inevitably because of parts used only si470x usb in the common file.  The current driver version doesn't support the RDS.
