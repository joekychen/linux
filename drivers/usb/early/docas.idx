f | ehci-dbgp.c | s | 25K | 929 | Jan Andersson | jan@gaisler.com | 1304448201 |  | USB: EHCI: Support controllers with big endian capability regs  The two first HC capability registers (CAPLENGTH and HCIVERSION) are defined as one 8-bit and one 16-bit register. Most HC implementations have selected to treat these registers as part of a 32-bit register, giving the same layout for both big and small endian systems.  This patch adds a new quirk, big_endian_capbase, to support controllers with big endian register interfaces that treat HCIVERSION and CAPLENGTH as individual registers.

None of the dependencies are modified.
