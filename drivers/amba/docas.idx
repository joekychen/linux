f | Makefile | g | 73B |  | Hiroshi DOYU | hdoyu@nvidia.com | 1336505449 |  | ARM: tegra: Add Tegra AHB driver  Tegra AHB Bus conforms to the AMBA Specification (Rev 2.0) Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) architecture.  The AHB Arbiter controls AHB bus master arbitration. This effectively forms a second level of arbitration for access to the memory controller through the AHB Slave Memory device. The AHB pre-fetch logic can be configured to enhance performance for devices doing sequential access. Each AHB master is assigned to either the high or low priority bin. Both Tegra20/30 have this AHB bus.  Some of configuration params could be passed from DT too if needed.
