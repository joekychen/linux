f | fw.c | s | 25K | 734 | Larry Finger | Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net | 1327956530 |  | rtlwifi: Convert to asynchronous firmware load  This patch addresses a kernel bugzilla report and two recent mail threads.  The kernel bugzilla report is https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42632, which reports a udev timeout on boot.  The first mail thread, which was on LKML (http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/ linux/kernel/1112.3/00965.html) was for a WARNING that occurs after a suspend/resume cycle for rtl8192cu.  The scond mail thread (http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=132655490826766&w=2) concerned changes in udev that break drivers that delay while firmware is loaded on modprobe.  This patch converts all rtlwifi-based drivers to use the asynchronous firmware loading mechanism. Drivers rtl8192ce, rtl8192cu and rtl8192de share a common callback routine. Driver rtl8192se needs different handling of the firmware, thus it has its own code.

The previous definitions included both {B,C,D,E}_CUT_VERSION and CHIP_92D_{C,D}_CUT with conflicting values for the C and D cut versions, and literal hex values were used in the IS_92D_{C,D,E}_CUT macros.  So we clean all this up and in doing so enable cut-specific code paths for cuts C and D, which would not have been executed because the CHIP_92D_{C,D}_CUT constants were wrong and the cut version was thus recorded incorrectly.
