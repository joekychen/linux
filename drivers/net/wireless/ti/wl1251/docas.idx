However currently there is a time window between request_irq() and disable_irq() where if interrupt arrives, the driver oopses because it's not yet ready to process it. This can be reproduced by inserting the module, associating and removing the module multiple times.  Eliminate this race by setting IRQF_NOAUTOEN flag before request_irq().

In 'net' we added a bug fix to make iwlwifi report a more accurate skb->truesize but this conflicted with RX path changes that happened meanwhile in net-next.  In e1000e a conflict arose in the validation code for settings of adapter->itr.  'net-next' had more sophisticated logic so that logic was used.  Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
