If we request irq handling after an interrupt has occurred, we will never get an interrupt until we call H_RESET_EVENTS.  Events seem to be cleared when we first register the NEQ. So, when we requested irq handling right after registering it, a possible race with an interrupt was much less likely. Now, there is a chance we may lose this race and never get any events.  The fix here is to poll and acknowledge any events that might have happened right after registering the irq handler.

It was ignoring the scope bit, which was wrongly being used for all filters. The SCOPE_ALL value adds a filter that allows all multicast packets and ignores the MAC parameter, just what allmulticast needs. The normals filters, however, should not use SCOPE_ALL.
