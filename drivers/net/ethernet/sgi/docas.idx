f | meth.c | s | 24K | 767 | Joshua Kinard | kumba@gentoo.org | 1325009854 |  | net: meth: Add set_rx_mode hook to fix ICMPv6 neighbor discovery  SGI IP32 (O2)'s ethernet driver (meth) lacks a set_rx_mode function, which prevents IPv6 from working completely because any ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation requests aren't picked up by the driver.  So the machine can ping out and connect to other systems, but other systems will have a very hard time connecting to the O2.  Signed-off-by: Joshua Kinard <kumba@gentoo.org> Signed-off-by: David S.

It was found using the randconfig option during testing, MII would be selected but NET_CORE could be disabled.  This caused a dependency error.  Resolved the dependency by selecting NET_CORE when MII is selected.
