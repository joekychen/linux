This also fixes a build problem, as the driver needs a header file from the cirrus directory:  drivers/net/ethernet/apple/mac89x0.c:107:20: error: cs89x0.h: No such file or directory  Signed-off-by: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org> Signed-off-by: David S.

f | Kconfig | g | 1.9K |  | Jaccon Bastiaansen | jaccon.bastiaansen@gmail.com | 1328111390 |  | CS89x0 : add platform driver support  The CS89x0 ethernet controller is used on a number of evaluation boards, such as the MX31ADS. The current driver has memory address and IRQ settings for each board on which this controller is used. Driver updates are therefore required to support other boards that also use the CS89x0. To avoid these driver updates, a better mechanism (platform driver support) is added to communicate the board dependent settings to the driver.

This resolves the issue by moving the dirver and fixing up the respective Kconfig(s) and Makefile(s).  Thanks to Sascha for reporting the issue.  -v2 Fix a config error that was introduced with v1 by removing     the dependency on MACE for NET_VENDOR_APPLE.
