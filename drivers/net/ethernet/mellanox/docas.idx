f | Kconfig | g | 663B |  | Jeff Kirsher | jeffrey.t.kirsher@intel.com | 1314431936 |  | drivers/net/ethernet/*: Enabled vendor Kconfig options  Based on finds for Stephen Rothwell, where current defconfig's enable a ethernet driver and it is not compiled due to the newly added NET_VENDOR_* component of Kconfig.  This patch enables all the "new" Kconfig options so that current defconfig's will continue to compile the expected drivers.  In addition, by enabling all the new Kconfig options does not add any un-expected options.  CC: Stephen Rothwll <sfc@canb.auug.org.au> Signed-off-by: Jeff Kirsher <jeffrey.t.kirsher@intel.com>
