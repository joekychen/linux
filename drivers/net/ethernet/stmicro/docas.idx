d | stmmac |  | 27 items |  | Stefan Roese | sr@denx.de | 1339458495 |  | net: stmmac: Fix clock en-/disable calls  clk_{un}prepare is mandatory for platforms using common clock framework. Since these drivers are used by SPEAr platform, which supports common clock framework, add clk_{un}prepare() support for them. Otherwise the clocks are not correctly en-/disabled and ethernet support doesn't work.

f | Kconfig | g | 689B |  | Jeff Kirsher | jeffrey.t.kirsher@intel.com | 1314431936 |  | drivers/net/ethernet/*: Enabled vendor Kconfig options  Based on finds for Stephen Rothwell, where current defconfig's enable a ethernet driver and it is not compiled due to the newly added NET_VENDOR_* component of Kconfig.  This patch enables all the "new" Kconfig options so that current defconfig's will continue to compile the expected drivers.  In addition, by enabling all the new Kconfig options does not add any un-expected options.  CC: Stephen Rothwll <sfc@canb.auug.org.au> Signed-off-by: Jeff Kirsher <jeffrey.t.kirsher@intel.com>
