Support includes the following:  1. Configure vif parameters in firmware (default vlan, vif id, default    priority, allowed priorities) according to values received from NIC. 2. Configure FW to strip/add default vlan according to afex vlan mode. 3. Notify link up to OS only after vif is fully initialized. 4. Support vif list set/get requests and configure FW accordingly. 5. Supply afex statistics upon request from NIC. 6. Special handling to L2 interface in case of FCoE vif.

TCP stack happily accepts frames with bad checksums, if they are inside a GRE or IPIP encapsulation.  Our understanding is that if no IP or L4 csum validation was done by the hardware, we should leave ip_summed as is (CHECKSUM_NONE), since hardware doesn't provide CHECKSUM_COMPLETE support in its cqe.  Then, if IP/L4 checksumming was done by the hardware, set CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY if no error was flagged.

In e1000e a conflict arose in the validation code for settings of adapter->itr.  'net-next' had more sophisticated logic so that logic was used.  Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
