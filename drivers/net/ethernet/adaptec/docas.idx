f | Kconfig | g | 1.1K |  | Jeff Kirsher | jeffrey.t.kirsher@intel.com | 1316116148 |  | MII: fix Kconfig dependencies for MII  MII Kconfig option is apart of the core networking drivers and by default NET_CORE is enabled so drivers selecting MII will have MII enabled as well.  It was found using the randconfig option during testing, MII would be selected but NET_CORE could be disabled.  This caused a dependency error.  Resolved the dependency by selecting NET_CORE when MII is selected.
