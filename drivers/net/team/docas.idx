f | team_mode_loadbalance.c | s | 3.9K | 151 | Jiri Pirko | jpirko@redhat.com | 1335039993 |  | team: allow to enable/disable ports  This patch changes content of hashlist (used to get port struct by computed index (0...en_port_count-1)). Now the hash list contains only enabled ports so userspace will be able to say what ports can be used for tx/rx. This becomes handy when userspace will need to disable ports which does not belong to active aggregator. By default, newly added port is enabled.
