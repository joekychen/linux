I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

I tried to make sure that we don't hold the socket lock during sleeping functions, but I did not try to prove whether the locks are necessary in the first place.  Compile-tested only.
