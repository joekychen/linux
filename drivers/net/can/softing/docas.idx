f | softing_fw.c | s | 18K | 642 | Alexey Dobriyan | adobriyan@gmail.com | 1308709040 |  | net: remove mm.h inclusion from netdevice.h  Remove linux/mm.h inclusion from netdevice.h -- it's unused (I've checked manually).  To prevent mm.h inclusion via other channels also extract "enum dma_data_direction" definition into separate header. This tiny piece is what gluing netdevice.h with mm.h via "netdevice.h => dmaengine.h => dma-mapping.h => scatterlist.h => mm.h". Removal of mm.h from scatterlist.h was tried and was found not feasible on most archs, so the link was cutoff earlier.  Hope people are OK with tiny include file.  Note, that mm_types.h is still dragged in, but it is a separate story.  Signed-off-by: Alexey Dobriyan <adobriyan@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

This driver will work independent, but no CAN network devices appear until softing.ko is loaded too.
