f | irtty-sir.c | s | 14K | 466 | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1307136804 |  | Revert "tty: make receive_buf() return the amout of bytes received"  This reverts commit b1c43f82c5aa265442f82dba31ce985ebb7aa71c.  It was broken in so many ways, and results in random odd pty issues.  It re-introduced the buggy schedule_work() in flush_to_ldisc() that can cause endless work-loops (see commit a5660b41af6a: "tty: fix endless work loop when the buffer fills up").  It also used an "unsigned int" return value fo the ->receive_buf() function, but then made multiple functions return a negative error code, and didn't actually check for the error in the caller.  And it didn't actually work at all.  BenH bisected down odd tty behavior to it:   "It looks like the patch is causing some major malfunctions of the X    server for me, possibly related to PTYs.  For example, cat'ing a    large file in a gnome terminal hangs the kernel for -minutes- in a    loop of what looks like flush_to_ldisc/workqueue code, (some ftrace    data in the quoted bits further down).     ...     Some more data: It -looks- like what happens is that the    flush_to_ldisc work queue entry constantly re-queues itself (because    the PTY is full ?) and the workqueue thread will basically loop    forver calling it without ever scheduling, thus starving the consumer    process that could have emptied the PTY."  which is pretty much exactly the problem we fixed in a5660b41af6a.  Milton Miller pointed out the 'unsigned int' issue.

One of them was printed as part of a printk, which also doesn't make much sense for a 5 year old and no longer updated keyword.  Signed-off-by: Adrian Bunk <bunk@kernel.org> Signed-off-by: David S.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
