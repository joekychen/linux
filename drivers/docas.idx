d | net |  | 44 items |  | Bruce Allan | bruce.w.allan@intel.com | 1341127532 |  | e1000e: remove use of IP payload checksum  Currently only used when packet split mode is enabled with jumbo frames, IP payload checksum (for fragmented UDP packets) is mutually exclusive with receive hashing offload since the hardware uses the same space in the receive descriptor for the hardware-provided packet checksum and the RSS hash, respectively.  Users currently must disable jumbos when receive hashing offload is enabled, or vice versa, because of this incompatibility. Since testing has shown that IP payload checksum does not provide any real benefit, just remove it so that there is no longer a choice between jumbos or receive hashing offload but not both as done in other Intel GbE drivers (e.g. e1000, igb).  Also, add a missing check for IP checksum error reported by the hardware; let the stack verify the checksum when this happens.

d | sn |  | 3 items |  | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

At present reserving the IRLs in the IRQ bitmap in addition to the dropping of the legacy IRQ pre-allocation prevent IRL IRQs from being allocated for the x3proto board.  The only reason to permit reservations was to lock down possible hardware vectors prior to dynamic IRQ scanning, but this doesn't matter much given that the hardware controller configuration is sorted before we get around to doing any dynamic IRQ allocation anyways. Beyond that, all of the tables are __init annotated, so quite a bit more work would need to be done to support reconfiguring things like IRL controllers on the fly, much more than would ever make it worth the hassle.

After bisecting, this commit dba3c29 is found to ruin micro-SD card data (writing incorrect file, or fs is corrupt after several times mount) on the beagle-xm revB, and reverting the commit will fix the problem.  Also from TRM of OMAP3/OMAP4/DM37x, the below is mentioned about the Auto CMD12 Enable bit.         - SDIO does not support this feature.         - SD card only. Looks it is not suitable to always enable Auto CMD12 in host controller driver.  Considered that the commit is not mature enough, so ask to revert it first.

Unfortunately we can't do this as early as readon does (i.e. as the first thing we do when initializing the hw) because our fb/mmio space region moves around on a per-gen basis. So I've had to move it below the gtt initialization, but that seems to work, too. The important thing is that we do this before we set up the gtt wc mapping.  Now an altogether different question is why people compile their kernels with vesafb enabled, but I guess making things just work isn't bad per se ...  v2: - s/radeondrmfb/inteldrmfb/ - fix up error handling  v3: Kill #ifdef X86, this is Intel after all. Noticed by Ben Widawsky.  v4: Jani Nikula complained about the pointless bool primary initialization.  v5: Don't oops if we can't allocate, noticed by Chris Wilson.  v6: Resolve conflicts with agp rework and fixup whitespace.  This is commit e188719a2891f01b3100d in drm-next.  Backport to 3.5 -fixes queue requested by Dave Airlie - due to grub using vesa on fedora their initrd seems to load vesafb before loading the real kms driver. So tons more people actually experience a dead-slow gpu. Hence also the Cc: stable.

However, the "del_timer(&fd_timeout)" was lost in the process, and any previous pending timeouts would stay active when we then re-queued the timeout.  This resulted in the floppy probe sequence having a (stale) 20s timeout rather than the intended 3s timeout, and thus made booting with the floppy driver (but no actual floppy controller) take much longer than it should.  Of course, there's little reason for most people to compile the floppy driver into the kernel at all, which is why most people never noticed.  Canceling the delayed work where we used to do the del_timer() fixes the issue, and makes the floppy probing use the proper new timeout instead. The three second timeout is still very wasteful, but better than the 20s one.

Users have been forced to unbind or unload ehci-hcd before putting their systems to sleep.  After extensive testing, it was determined that the machines don't like going into suspend when any EHCI controllers are in the PCI D3 power state.  Presumably this is a firmware bug, but there's nothing we can do about it except to avoid putting the controllers in D3 during system sleep.  The patch adds a new flag to indicate whether the problem is present, and avoids changing the controller's power state if the flag is set. Runtime suspend is unaffected; this matters only for system suspend. However as a side effect, the controller will not respond to remote wakeup requests while the system is asleep.  Hence USB wakeup is not functional -- but of course, this is already true in the current state of affairs.  A similar patch has already been applied as commit 151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 (USB: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS computers).  The patch supersedes that one and reverts it.  There are two differences:  	The old patch added the flag at the USB level; this patch 	adds it at the PCI level.  	The old patch applied to all chipsets with the same vendor, 	subsystem vendor, and product IDs; this patch makes an 	exception for a known-good system (based on DMI information).

d | connector |  | 5 items |  | Vladimir Zapolskiy | vzapolskiy@gmail.com | 1317231710 |  | connector: add comm change event report to proc connector  Add an event to monitor comm value changes of tasks.  Such an event becomes vital, if someone desires to control threads of a process in different manner.  A natural characteristic of threads is its comm value, and helpfully application developers have an opportunity to change it in runtime. Reporting about such events via proc connector allows to fine-grain monitoring and control potentials, for instance a process control daemon listening to proc connector and following comm value policies can place specific threads to assigned cgroup partitions.  It might be possible to achieve a pale partial one-shot likeness without this update, if an application changes comm value of a thread generator task beforehand, then a new thread is cloned, and after that proc connector listener gets the fork event and reads new thread's comm value from procfs stat file, but this change visibly simplifies and extends the matter.

They report bogus sizes, in some cases becoming unusable as a result.  The bugs were triggered by commit 09b6b51b0b6c1b9bb61815baf205e4d74c89ff04 (SCSI & usb-storage: add flags for VPD pages and REPORT LUNS), which caused usb-storage to stop overriding the SCSI level reported by devices.  By default, the sd driver will try READ CAPACITY(16) first for any device whose level is above SCSI_SPC_2.  It seems likely that any device large enough to require the use of READ CAPACITY(16) (i.e., 2 TB or more) would be able to handle READ CAPACITY(10) commands properly.  Indeed, I don't know of any devices that don't handle READ CAPACITY(10) properly.  Therefore this patch (as1559) adds a new flag telling the sd driver to try READ CAPACITY(10) before READ CAPACITY(16), and sets this flag for every USB mass-storage device.  If a device really is larger than 2 TB, sd will fall back to READ CAPACITY(16) just as it used to.  This fixes Bugzilla #43391.

d | tc |  | 3 items |  | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.
