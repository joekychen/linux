f | r128_state.c | s | 40K | 1330 | Dave Airlie | airlied@redhat.com | 1282020745 |  | drm: block userspace under allocating buffer and having drivers overwrite it (v2)  With the current screwed but its ABI, ioctls for the drm, Linus pointed out that we could allow userspace to specify the allocation size, but we pass it to the driver which then uses it blindly to store a struct. Now if userspace specifies the allocation size as smaller than the driver needs, the driver can possibly overwrite memory.  This patch restructures the driver ioctls so we store the structure size we are expecting, and make sure we allocate at least that size. The copy from/to userspace are still restricted to the size the user specifies, this allows ioctl structs to grow on both sides of the equation.  Up until now we didn't really use the DRM_IOCTL defines in the kernel, so this cleans them up and adds them for nouveau.  v2: fix nouveau pushbuf arg (thanks to Ben for pointing it out)  Reported-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org> Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>
f | r128_ioc32.c | s | 6.8K | 185 | Arnd Bergmann | arnd@arndb.de | 1261099351 |  | drm: convert drm_ioctl to unlocked_ioctl  drm_ioctl is called with the Big Kernel Lock held, which shows up very high in statistics on vfs_ioctl.  Moving the lock into the drm_ioctl function itself makes sure we blame the right subsystem and it gets us one step closer to eliminating the locked version of fops->ioctl.  Since drm_ioctl does not require the lock itself, we only need to hold it while calling the specific handler. The 32 bit conversion handlers do not interact with any other code, so they don't need the BKL here either and can just call drm_ioctl.  As a bonus, this cleans up all the other users of drm_ioctl which now no longer have to find the inode or call lock_kernel.  [airlied: squashed the non-driver bits of the second patch in here, this provides the flag for drivers to use to select unlocked ioctls - but doesn't modify any drivers].

With the coming of kernel based modesetting and the memory manager stuff, the everything in one directory approach was getting very ugly and starting to be unmanageable.  This restructures the drm along the lines of other kernel components.  It creates a drivers/gpu/drm directory and moves the hw drivers into subdirectores. It moves the includes into an include/drm, and sets up the unifdef for the userspace headers we should be exporting.  Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>
f | r128_drv.c | s | 3.4K | 101 | Dave Airlie | airlied@redhat.com | 1329417067 |  | drm: move pci bus master enable into driver.  The current enabling of bus mastering in the drm midlayer allows a large race condition under kexec. When a kexec'ed kernel re-enables bus mastering for the GPU, previously setup dma blocks may cause writes to random pieces of memory. On radeon the writeback mechanism can cause these sorts of issues.  This patch doesn't fix the problem, but it moves the bus master enable under the individual drivers control so they can move enabling it until later in their load cycle and close the race.  Fix for radeon kms driver will be in a follow-up patch.  Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>
