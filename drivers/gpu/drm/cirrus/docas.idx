This driver only supports the emulated GPU and doesn't attempt to bind to any real cirrus GPUs.  This driver is intended to be used with xf86-video-modesetting in userspace. It requires at least version 0.3.0  This follow the same design as ast and mgag200, and is based on work done by Matthew Garrett previously.  This GPU has no hw cursor, and it can't scanout 32-bpp, only packed 24-bpp. i.e. it sucks.  Reviewed-by: Adam Jackson <ajax@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>
