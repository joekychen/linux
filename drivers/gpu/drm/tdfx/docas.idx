For consistency (and the general security objective of having such things static), it's desirable to get this fixed.  This patch splits out the file_operations field to its own struct, which is then "static const", and just stick a pointer to this into the driver struct, making it more consistent with how the rest of the kernel does this.

With the coming of kernel based modesetting and the memory manager stuff, the everything in one directory approach was getting very ugly and starting to be unmanageable.  This restructures the drm along the lines of other kernel components.  It creates a drivers/gpu/drm directory and moves the hw drivers into subdirectores. It moves the includes into an include/drm, and sets up the unifdef for the userspace headers we should be exporting.  Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>
