It will bind to G200 SE A,B, G200EV, G200WB, G200EH and G200ER cards.  Its based on previous work done my Matthew Garrett but remodelled to follow the same style and flow as the AST server driver. It also works along the same lines as the AST server driver wrt memory management.  There is no userspace driver planned, xf86-video-modesetting should be used. It also appears these GPUs have no ARGB hw cursors.  v2: add missing tagfifo reset + G200 SE memory bw setup pieces.  Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>

It appears grub2 can pass framebuffer info via efifb, so we need to kick it off earlier to reserve the vram allocation.
