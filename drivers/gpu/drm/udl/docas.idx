On an unplug, it disables connector polling, unplugs connectors from sysfs, unplugs fbdev layer (using Kay's API), drops all the USB device URBs, and call the drm core to unplug the device.

The driver was not using le16_to_cpu when reading keys from the vendor descriptor, causing incorrect parsing. Mainly, sku_pixel_limit was not being parsed on big-endian systems. This would result in a blank screen on big-endian CPUs where the DL chips's max mode was smaller than the monitor's native mode.  Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>
