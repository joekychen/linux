This is meant as a unit test for raid6 acceleration drivers.  In addition to the 16-drive test case this implements tests for the 4-disk and 5-disk special cases (dma devices can not generically handle less than 2 sources), and adds a test for the D+Q case.

All the options in crypto/async_tx/Kconfig are selected and do not depend on CRYPTO. Kconfig.debug seems like a reasonable fit.
