We can make this change risk-free, since if the files using these headers didn't have exposure to linux/bug.h already, they would have been causing compile failures/warnings.

The most well-known of these devices is probably the Linksys WRT54G, but there are others as well.  The bus is also used internally on the BCM43xx and BCM44xx devices from Broadcom.  This patch also includes support for SSB ID tables in modules, so that SSB drivers can be loaded automatically.  Signed-off-by: Michael Buesch <mb@bu3sch.de> Signed-off-by: John W.

f | ssb.h | s | 18K | 542 | Hauke Mehrtens | hauke@hauke-m.de | 1337186720 |  | ssb: remove rev from boardinfo  Previously the rev contained the revision read from the pci config space and was used as board_rev in the wireless drivers. This is wrong the board_rev is only fetched from the sprom accordingly to the open source part of the Broadcom SDK and brcmsmac. This patch removes the rev from the boardinfo structure and uses the board_rev attribute from sprom instead. This attribute is filled by PCI, PCMCIA, SDIO and SoC code.
