It should also address the various misconceptions and confusions that surround jump labels.  Typical usage scenarios:          #include <linux/static_key.h>          struct static_key key = STATIC_KEY_INIT_TRUE;          if (static_key_false(&key))                 do unlikely code         else                 do likely code  Or:          if (static_key_true(&key))                 do likely code         else                 do unlikely code  The static key is modified via:          static_key_slow_inc(&key);         ...         static_key_slow_dec(&key);  The 'slow' prefix makes it abundantly clear that this is an expensive operation.  I've updated all in-kernel code to use this everywhere. Note that I (intentionally) have not pushed through the rename blindly through to the lowest levels: the actual jump-label patching arch facility should be named like that, so we want to decouple jump labels from the static-key facility a bit.  On non-jump-label enabled architectures static keys default to likely()/unlikely() branches.

We want to do this so that the macvlan driver or stack above the macvlan driver does not have to process every packet. For the use case where we know all the MAC addresses of the endstations above us this works well.  This patch is a result of Roopa Prabhu's work.

Users have been forced to unbind or unload ehci-hcd before putting their systems to sleep.  After extensive testing, it was determined that the machines don't like going into suspend when any EHCI controllers are in the PCI D3 power state.  Presumably this is a firmware bug, but there's nothing we can do about it except to avoid putting the controllers in D3 during system sleep.  The patch adds a new flag to indicate whether the problem is present, and avoids changing the controller's power state if the flag is set. Runtime suspend is unaffected; this matters only for system suspend. However as a side effect, the controller will not respond to remote wakeup requests while the system is asleep.  Hence USB wakeup is not functional -- but of course, this is already true in the current state of affairs.  A similar patch has already been applied as commit 151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 (USB: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS computers).  The patch supersedes that one and reverts it.  There are two differences:  	The old patch added the flag at the USB level; this patch 	adds it at the PCI level.  	The old patch applied to all chipsets with the same vendor, 	subsystem vendor, and product IDs; this patch makes an 	exception for a known-good system (based on DMI information).

New xdr_stream style decoders can do that.  For efficiency, we also eventually want to be able to pass xdr_streams from call_decode() to all XDR decoding functions, rather than building an xdr_stream in every XDR decoding function in the kernel.  Static helper functions are left without the "inline" directive.  This allows the compiler to choose automatically how to optimize these for size or speed.

Every pair of AMP processors share two vrings, which are used to send and receive the messages over shared memory.  The header of every message sent on the rpmsg bus contains src and dst addresses, which make it possible to multiplex several rpmsg channels on the same vring.  Every rpmsg channel is a device on this bus. When a channel is added, and an appropriate rpmsg driver is found and probed, it is also assigned a local rpmsg address, which is then bound to the driver's callback.  When inbound messages carry the local address of a bound driver, its callback is invoked by the bus.  This patch provides a kernel interface only; user space interfaces will be later exposed by kernel users of this rpmsg bus.  Designed with Brian Swetland <swetland@google.com>.

Stephen says: "If the callback function is to no longer live in 8250.c itself,  arch/arm/mach-tegra/devices.c isn't logically a good place to put it,  and that file will be going away once we get rid of all the board files  and move solely to device tree."  ...so since 8250_pci.c houses all the quirks for pci serial devices this quirk is similarly housed in of_serial.c.  Once the open firmware conversion completes the infrastructure details (include/linux/of_serial.h, and the export) can all be removed to make this self contained to of_serial.c.

f | zconf.h | s | 1.7K | 46 | Richard Purdie | rpurdie@rpsys.net | 1151013958 |  | [PATCH] zlib_inflate: Upgrade library code to a recent version  Upgrade the zlib_inflate implementation in the kernel from a patched version 1.1.3/4 to a patched 1.2.3.  The code in the kernel is about seven years old and I noticed that the external zlib library's inflate performance was significantly faster (~50%) than the code in the kernel on ARM (and faster again on x86_32).  For comparison the newer deflate code is 20% slower on ARM and 50% slower on x86_32 but gives an approx 1% compression ratio improvement.  I don't consider this to be an improvement for kernel use so have no plans to change the zlib_deflate code.  Various changes have been made to the zlib code in the kernel, the most significant being the extra functions/flush option used by ppp_deflate. This update reimplements the features PPP needs to ensure it continues to work.  This code has been tested on ARM under both JFFS2 (with zlib compression enabled) and ppp_deflate and on x86_32.  JFFS2 sees an approx.  10% real world file read speed improvement.  This patch also removes ZLIB_VERSION as it no longer has a correct value. We don't need version checks anyway as the kernel's module handling will take care of that for us.  This removal is also more in keeping with the zlib author's wishes (http://www.zlib.net/zlib_faq.html#faq24) and I've added something to the zlib.h header to note its a modified version.

This facility makes it possible for the kernel to upcall to userspace to have it issue DNS requests, package up the replies and present them to the kernel in a useful form.  The kernel is then able to cache the DNS replies as keys can be retained in keyrings.  Resolver keys are of type "dns_resolver" and have a case-insensitive description that is of the form "[<type>:]<domain_name>".  The optional <type> indicates the particular DNS lookup and packaging that's required.  The <domain_name> is the query to be made.  If <type> isn't given, a basic hostname to IP address lookup is made, and the result is stored in the key in the form of a printable string consisting of a comma-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  This key type is supported by userspace helpers driven from /sbin/request-key and configured through /etc/request-key.conf.  The cifs.upcall utility is invoked for UNC path server name to IP address resolution.  The CIFS functionality is encapsulated by the dns_resolve_unc_to_ip() function, which is used to resolve a UNC path to an IP address for CIFS filesystem.  This part remains in the CIFS module for now.  See the added Documentation/networking/dns_resolver.txt for more information.

f | vhost.h | s | 4.5K | 107 | Michael S. Tsirkin | mst@redhat.com | 1263548609 |  | vhost_net: a kernel-level virtio server  What it is: vhost net is a character device that can be used to reduce the number of system calls involved in virtio networking. Existing virtio net code is used in the guest without modification.  There's similarity with vringfd, with some differences and reduced scope - uses eventfd for signalling - structures can be moved around in memory at any time (good for   migration, bug work-arounds in userspace) - write logging is supported (good for migration) - support memory table and not just an offset (needed for kvm)  common virtio related code has been put in a separate file vhost.c and can be made into a separate module if/when more backends appear.  I used Rusty's lguest.c as the source for developing this part : this supplied me with witty comments I wouldn't be able to write myself.  What it is not: vhost net is not a bus, and not a generic new system call. No assumptions are made on how guest performs hypercalls. Userspace hypervisors are supported as well as kvm.  How it works: Basically, we connect virtio frontend (configured by userspace) to a backend. The backend could be a network device, or a tap device.  Backend is also configured by userspace, including vlan/mac etc.  Status: This works for me, and I haven't see any crashes. Compared to userspace, people reported improved latency (as I save up to 4 system calls per packet), as well as better bandwidth and CPU utilization.  Features that I plan to look at in the future: - mergeable buffers - zero copy - scalability tuning: figure out the best threading model to use  Note on RCU usage (this is also documented in vhost.h, near private_pointer which is the value protected by this variant of RCU): what is happening is that the rcu_dereference() is being used in a workqueue item.  The role of rcu_read_lock() is taken on by the start of execution of the workqueue item, of rcu_read_unlock() by the end of execution of the workqueue item, and of synchronize_rcu() by flush_workqueue()/flush_work(). In the future we might need to apply some gcc attribute or sparse annotation to the function passed to INIT_WORK(). Paul's ack below is for this RCU usage.

f | edac.h | s | 20K | 551 | Mauro Carvalho Chehab | mchehab@redhat.com | 1338243230 |  | edac: Initialize the dimm label with the known information  While userspace doesn't fill the dimm labels, add there the dimm location, as described by the used memory model. This could eventually match what is described at the dmidecode, making easier for people to identify the memory.  For example, on an Intel motherboard where the DMI table is reliable, the first memory stick is described as:  Memory Device 	Array Handle: 0x0029 	Error Information Handle: Not Provided 	Total Width: 64 bits 	Data Width: 64 bits 	Size: 2048 MB 	Form Factor: DIMM 	Set: 1 	Locator: A1_DIMM0 	Bank Locator: A1_Node0_Channel0_Dimm0 	Type: <OUT OF SPEC> 	Type Detail: Synchronous 	Speed: 800 MHz 	Manufacturer: A1_Manufacturer0 	Serial Number: A1_SerNum0 	Asset Tag: A1_AssetTagNum0 	Part Number: A1_PartNum0  The memory named as "A1_DIMM0" is physically located at the first memory controller (node 0), at channel 0, dimm slot 0.  After this patch, the memory label will be filled with: 	/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/csrow0/ch0_dimm_label:mc#0channel#0slot#0  And (after the new EDAC API patches) as: 	/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc0/dimm0/dimm_label:mc#0channel#0slot#0  So, even if the memory label is not initialized on userspace, an useful information with the error location is filled there, expecially since several systems/motherboards are provided with enough info to map from channel/slot (or branch/channel/slot) into the DIMM label. So, letting the EDAC core fill it by default is a good thing.  It should noticed that, as the label filling happens at the edac_mc_alloc(), drivers can override it to better describe the memories (and some actually do it).

The polling is done by a work routine queued on the system_nrt_wq workqueue.  Since that workqueue isn't freezable, the polling continues even in the middle of a system sleep transition.  Obviously, polling a suspended drive for media changes and such isn't a good thing to do; in the case of USB mass-storage devices it can lead to real problems requiring device resets and even re-enumeration.

Working with task->mm w/o getting mm or grabing the task lock is    dangerous as ->mm might disappear (exit_mm() assigns NULL under    task_lock(), so tasklist lock is not enough).  2. Checking for process->mm is not enough because process' main    thread may exit or detach its mm via use_mm(), but other threads    may still have a valid mm.  This patch implements a small helper function that does things correctly, i.e.:  1. We take the task's lock while whe handle its mm (we can't use    get_task_mm()/mmput() pair as mmput() might sleep);  2. To catch exited main thread case, we use find_lock_task_mm(),    which walks up all threads and returns an appropriate task    (with task lock held).  Also, Per Peter Zijlstra's idea, now we don't grab tasklist_lock in the new helper, instead we take the rcu read lock. We can do this because the function is called after the cpu is taken down and marked offline, so no new tasks will get this cpu set in their mm mask.

f | delay.h | s | 1.4K | 44 | Patrick Pannuto | ppannuto@codeaurora.org | 1280912445 |  | timer: Added usleep_range timer  usleep_range is a finer precision implementations of msleep and is designed to be a drop-in replacement for udelay where a precise sleep / busy-wait is unnecessary.  Since an easy interface to hrtimers could lead to an undesired proliferation of interrupts, we provide only a "range" API, forcing the caller to think about an acceptable tolerance on both ends and hopefully avoiding introducing another interrupt.  INTRO  As discussed here ( http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/3/250 ), msleep(1) is not precise enough for many drivers (yes, sleep precision is an unfair notion, but consistently sleeping for ~an order of magnitude greater than requested is worth fixing). This patch adds a usleep API so that udelay does not have to be used. Obviously not every udelay can be replaced (those in atomic contexts or being used for simple bitbanging come to mind), but there are many, many examples of  mydriver_write(...) /* Wait for hardware to latch */ udelay(100)  in various drivers where a busy-wait loop is neither beneficial nor necessary, but msleep simply does not provide enough precision and people are using a busy-wait loop instead.  CONCERNS FROM THE RFC  Why is udelay a problem / necessary? Most callers of udelay are in device/ driver initialization code, which is serial...  	As I see it, there is only benefit to sleeping over a delay; the 	notion of "refactoring" areas that use udelay was presented, but 	I see usleep as the refactoring. Consider i2c, if the bus is busy, 	you need to wait a bit (say 100us) before trying again, your 	current options are:  		* udelay(100) 		* msleep(1) <-- As noted above, actually as high as ~20ms 				on some platforms, so not really an option 		* Manually set up an hrtimer to try again in 100us (which 		  is what usleep does anyway...)  	People choose the udelay route because it is EASY; we need to 	provide a better easy route.  	Device / driver / boot code is *currently* serial, but every few 	months someone makes noise about parallelizing boot, and IMHO, a 	little forward-thinking now is one less thing to worry about 	if/when that ever happens  udelay's could be preempted  	Sure, but if udelay plans on looping 1000 times, and it gets 	preempted on loop 200, whenever it's scheduled again, it is 	going to do the next 800 loops.  Is the interruptible case needed?  	Probably not, but I see usleep as a very logical parallel to msleep, 	so it made sense to include the "full" API. Processors are getting 	faster (albeit not as quickly as they are becoming more parallel), 	so if someone wanted to be interruptible for a few usecs, why not 	let them? If this is a contentious point, I'm happy to remove it.  OTHER THOUGHTS  I believe there is also value in exposing the usleep_range option; it gives the scheduler a lot more flexibility and allows the programmer to express his intent much more clearly; it's something I would hope future driver writers will take advantage of.  To get the results in the NUMBERS section below, I literally s/udelay/usleep the kernel tree; I had to go in and undo the changes to the USB drivers, but everything else booted successfully; I find that extremely telling in and of itself -- many people are using a delay API where a sleep will suit them just fine.  SOME ATTEMPTS AT NUMBERS  It turns out that calculating quantifiable benefit on this is challenging, so instead I will simply present the current state of things, and I hope this to be sufficient:  How many udelay calls are there in 2.6.35-rc5?  	udealy(ARG) >=	|| COUNT 	1000		|| 319 	500		|| 414 	100		|| 1146 	20		|| 1832  I am working on Android, so that is my focus for this. The following table is a modified usleep that simply printk's the amount of time requested to sleep; these tests were run on a kernel with udelay >= 20 --> usleep  "boot" is power-on to lock screen "power collapse" is when the power button is pushed and the device suspends "resume" is when the power button is pushed and the lock screen is displayed          (no touchscreen events or anything, just turning on the display) "use device" is from the unlock swipe to clicking around a bit; there is no 	sd card in this phone, so fail loading music, video, camera  	ACTION		|| TOTAL NUMBER OF USLEEP CALLS	|| NET TIME (us) 	boot		|| 22				|| 1250 	power-collapse	|| 9				|| 1200 	resume		|| 5				|| 500 	use device	|| 59				|| 7700  The most interesting category to me is the "use device" field; 7700us of busy-wait time that could be put towards better responsiveness, or at the least less power usage.

f | fadvise.h | s | 779B | 18 | Andrew Morton | akpm@osdl.org | 1143836334 |  | [PATCH] sys_sync_file_range()  Remove the recently-added LINUX_FADV_ASYNC_WRITE and LINUX_FADV_WRITE_WAIT fadvise() additions, do it in a new sys_sync_file_range() syscall instead. Reasons:  - It's more flexible.  Things which would require two or three syscalls with   fadvise() can be done in a single syscall.  - Using fadvise() in this manner is something not covered by POSIX.  The patch wires up the syscall for x86.  The sycall is implemented in the new fs/sync.c.  The intention is that we can move sys_fsync(), sys_fdatasync() and perhaps sys_sync() into there later.  Documentation for the syscall is in fs/sync.c.  A test app (sync_file_range.c) is in http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz.  The available-to-GPL-modules do_sync_file_range() is for knfsd: "A COMMIT can say NFS_DATA_SYNC or NFS_FILE_SYNC.  I can skip the ->fsync call for NFS_DATA_SYNC which is hopefully the more common."  Note: the `async' writeout mode SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE will turn synchronous if the queue is congested.  This is trivial to fix: add a new flag bit, set wbc->nonblocking.  But I'm not sure that we want to expose implementation details down to that level.  Note: it's notable that we can sync an fd which wasn't opened for writing. Same with fsync() and fdatasync()).  Note: the code takes some care to handle attempts to sync file contents outside the 16TB offset on 32-bit machines.  It makes such attempts appear to succeed, for best 32-bit/64-bit compatibility.  Perhaps it should make such requests fail...

Furthermore, "(none)" doesn't typically resolve to anything useful.  Make the default hostname configurable.  This removes the need for the standard fallback, provides a useful default for systems that never call sethostname, and makes minimal systems that much more useful with less configuration.

Additionally a flags field was added and a NOPROMISC bit to allow users to use passthru mode without the driver calling dev_set_promiscuity(). The flags field is a u16 placed in a 4 byte hole (consuming 2 bytes) of the macvlan_dev struct.  We want to do this so that the macvlan driver or stack above the macvlan driver does not have to process every packet. For the use case where we know all the MAC addresses of the endstations above us this works well.  This patch is a result of Roopa Prabhu's work. Follow up patches are needed for VEPA and VEB macvlan modes.  v2: Change from distinct nopromisc mode to a flags field to     configure this. This avoids the tendency to add a new     mode every time we need some slightly different behavior. v3: fix error in dev_set_promiscuity and add change and get     link attributes for flags.

f | pipe_fs_i.h | s | 5.8K | 145 | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1335730362 |  | pipes: add a "packetized pipe" mode for writing  The actual internal pipe implementation is already really about individual packets (called "pipe buffers"), and this simply exposes that as a special packetized mode.  When we are in the packetized mode (marked by O_DIRECT as suggested by Alan Cox), a write() on a pipe will not merge the new data with previous writes, so each write will get a pipe buffer of its own.  The pipe buffer is then marked with the PIPE_BUF_FLAG_PACKET flag, which in turn will tell the reader side to break the read at that boundary (and throw away any partial packet contents that do not fit in the read buffer).  End result: as long as you do writes less than PIPE_BUF in size (so that the pipe doesn't have to split them up), you can now treat the pipe as a packet interface, where each read() system call will read one packet at a time.  You can just use a sufficiently big read buffer (PIPE_BUF is sufficient, since bigger than that doesn't guarantee atomicity anyway), and the return value of the read() will naturally give you the size of the packet.  NOTE! We do not support zero-sized packets, and zero-sized reads and writes to a pipe continue to be no-ops.  Also note that big packets will currently be split at write time, but that the size at which that happens is not really specified (except that it's bigger than PIPE_BUF). Currently that limit is the system page size, but we might want to explicitly support bigger packets some day.  The main user for this is going to be the autofs packet interface, allowing us to stop having to care so deeply about exact packet sizes (which have had bugs with 32/64-bit compatibility modes).  But user space can create packetized pipes with "pipe2(fd, O_DIRECT)", which will fail with an EINVAL on kernels that do not support this interface.

This is a libary which allows a queue limit to be dynamically managed.  The goal of dql is to set the queue limit, number of objects to the queue, to be minimized without allowing the queue to be starved.  dql would be used with a queue which has these properties:  1) Objects are queued up to some limit which can be expressed as a    count of objects. 2) Periodically a completion process executes which retires consumed    objects. 3) Starvation occurs when limit has been reached, all queued data has    actually been consumed but completion processing has not yet run,    so queuing new data is blocked. 4) Minimizing the amount of queued data is desirable.  A canonical example of such a queue would be a NIC HW transmit queue.  The queue limit is dynamic, it will increase or decrease over time depending on the workload.  The queue limit is recalculated each time completion processing is done.  Increases occur when the queue is starved and can exponentially increase over successive intervals. Decreases occur when more data is being maintained in the queue than needed to prevent starvation.  The number of extra objects, or "slack", is measured over successive intervals, and to avoid hysteresis the limit is only reduced by the miminum slack seen over a configurable time period.  dql API provides routines to manage the queue: - dql_init is called to intialize the dql structure - dql_reset is called to reset dynamic values - dql_queued called when objects are being enqueued - dql_avail returns availability in the queue - dql_completed is called when objects have be consumed in the queue  Configuration consists of: - max_limit, maximum limit - min_limit, minimum limit - slack_hold_time, time to measure instances of slack before reducing   queue limit  Signed-off-by: Tom Herbert <therbert@google.com> Acked-by: Eric Dumazet <eric.dumazet@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: David S.

d | usb |  | 51 items |  | Alan Stern | stern@rowland.harvard.edu | 1339618299 |  | USB: add NO_D3_DURING_SLEEP flag and revert 151b61284776be2  This patch (as1558) fixes a problem affecting several ASUS computers: The machine crashes or corrupts memory when going into suspend if the ehci-hcd driver is bound to any controllers.  Users have been forced to unbind or unload ehci-hcd before putting their systems to sleep.  After extensive testing, it was determined that the machines don't like going into suspend when any EHCI controllers are in the PCI D3 power state.  Presumably this is a firmware bug, but there's nothing we can do about it except to avoid putting the controllers in D3 during system sleep.  The patch adds a new flag to indicate whether the problem is present, and avoids changing the controller's power state if the flag is set. Runtime suspend is unaffected; this matters only for system suspend. However as a side effect, the controller will not respond to remote wakeup requests while the system is asleep.  Hence USB wakeup is not functional -- but of course, this is already true in the current state of affairs.  A similar patch has already been applied as commit 151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 (USB: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS computers).  The patch supersedes that one and reverts it.  There are two differences:  	The old patch added the flag at the USB level; this patch 	adds it at the PCI level.  	The old patch applied to all chipsets with the same vendor, 	subsystem vendor, and product IDs; this patch makes an 	exception for a known-good system (based on DMI information).

Recent commit "irq: Track the  owner of irq descriptor" in commit ID b6873807a7143b7 placed module.h into linux/irq.h but we are trying to limit module.h inclusion to just C files that really need it, due to its size and number of children includes.  This targets just reversing that include.  Add in the basic "struct module" since that is all we really need to ensure things compile.  In theory, b687380 should have added the module.h include to the irqdesc.h header as well, but the implicit module.h everywhere presence masked this from showing up.  So give it the "struct module" as well.  As for the C files, irqdesc.c is only using THIS_MODULE, so it does not need module.h - give it export.h instead.  The C file irq/manage.c is now (as of b687380) using try_module_get and module_put and so it needs module.h (which it already has).  Also convert the irq_alloc_descs variants to macros, since all they really do is is call the __irq_alloc_descs primitive. This avoids including export.h and no debug info is lost.

Accounting rules for longterm count: 	* 1 for each fs_struct.root.mnt 	* 1 for each fs_struct.pwd.mnt 	* 1 for having non-NULL ->mnt_ns 	* decrement to 0 happens only under vfsmount lock exclusive  That allows nice common case for mntput() - since we can't drop the final reference until after mnt_longterm has reached 0 due to the rules above, mntput() can grab vfsmount lock shared and check mnt_longterm. If it turns out to be non-zero (which is the common case), we know that this is not the final mntput() and can just blindly decrement percpu mnt_count.  Otherwise we grab vfsmount lock exclusive and do usual decrement-and-check of percpu mnt_count.  For fs_struct.c we have mnt_make_longterm() and mnt_make_shortterm(); namespace.c uses the latter in places where we don't already hold vfsmount lock exclusive and opencodes a few remaining spots where we need to manipulate mnt_longterm.  Note that we mostly revert the code outside of fs/namespace.c back to what we used to have; in particular, normal code doesn't need to care about two kinds of references, etc.  And we get to keep the optimization Nick's variant had bought us...

Whoops.  Yes, I blindly followed read_swap_header()'s pte_to_swp_entry( swp_entry_to_pte()) technique for determining maximum usable swap offset, without stopping to realize that that actually depends upon the pte swap encoding shifting swap offset to the higher bits and truncating it there.  Whereas our radix_tree swap encoding leaves offset in the lower bits: it's swap "type" (that is, index of swap area) that was truncated.  Fix it by reducing the SWP_TYPE_SHIFT() in swapops.h, and removing the broken radix_to_swp_entry(swp_to_radix_entry()) from read_swap_header().  This does not reduce the usable size of a swap area any further, it leaves it as claimed when making the original commit: no change from 3.0 on x86_64, nor on i386 without PAE; but 3.0's 512GB is reduced to 128GB per swapfile on i386 with PAE.  It's not a change I would have risked five years ago, but with x86_64 supported for ten years, I believe it's appropriate now.  Hmm, and what if some architecture implements its swap pte with offset encoded below type? That would equally break the maximum usable swap offset check.  Happily, they all follow the same tradition of encoding offset above type, but I'll prepare a check on that for next.

Clean up the users as follows:  1) For those headers only needing "struct device" as a pointer in fcn args, replace the include with exactly that.  2) For headers not really using anything from device.h, simply delete the include altogether.  3) For headers relying on getting device.h implicitly before being included themselves, now explicitly include device.h  4) For files in which doing #1 or #2 uncovers an implicit dependency on some other header, fix by explicitly adding the required header(s).  Any C files that were implicitly relying on device.h to be present have already been dealt with in advance.  Total removals from #1 and #2: 51.  Total additions coming from #3: 9.  Total other implicit dependencies from #4: 7.  As of 3.3-rc1, there were 110, so a net removal of 42 gives about a 38% reduction in device.h presence in include/*  Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>

Bus slaves (such as the ds2760) may interpret this as a reason for power-down conditions and entirely switch off the device.  This patch adds a callback function pointer to let users switch on and off the external pull-up resistor.  This lets the outside world know whether the processor is currently actively driving the bus or not.  When this callback is not provided, the code behaviour won't change.

At present reserving the IRLs in the IRQ bitmap in addition to the dropping of the legacy IRQ pre-allocation prevent IRL IRQs from being allocated for the x3proto board.  The only reason to permit reservations was to lock down possible hardware vectors prior to dynamic IRQ scanning, but this doesn't matter much given that the hardware controller configuration is sorted before we get around to doing any dynamic IRQ allocation anyways. Beyond that, all of the tables are __init annotated, so quite a bit more work would need to be done to support reconfiguring things like IRL controllers on the fly, much more than would ever make it worth the hassle.

f | init_ohci1394_dma.h | s | 157B | 4 | Bernhard Kaindl | bk@suse.de | 1201696451 |  | x86: early boot debugging via FireWire (ohci1394_dma=early)  This patch adds a new configuration option, which adds support for a new early_param which gets checked in arch/x86/kernel/setup_{32,64}.c:setup_arch() to decide wether OHCI-1394 FireWire controllers should be initialized and enabled for physical DMA access to allow remote debugging of early problems like issues ACPI or other subsystems which are executed very early.  If the config option is not enabled, no code is changed, and if the boot paramenter is not given, no new code is executed, and independent of that, all new code is freed after boot, so the config option can be even enabled in standard, non-debug kernels.  With specialized tools, it is then possible to get debugging information from machines which have no serial ports (notebooks) such as the printk buffer contents, or any data which can be referenced from global pointers, if it is stored below the 4GB limit and even memory dumps of of the physical RAM region below the 4GB limit can be taken without any cooperation from the CPU of the host, so the machine can be crashed early, it does not matter.  In the extreme, even kernel debuggers can be accessed in this way. I wrote a small kgdb module and an accompanying gdb stub for FireWire which allows to gdb to talk to kgdb using remote remory reads and writes over FireWire.  An version of the gdb stub fore FireWire is able to read all global data from a system which is running a a normal kernel without any kernel debugger, without any interruption or support of the system's CPU. That way, e.g. the task struct and so on can be read and even manipulated when the physical DMA access is granted.  A HOWTO is included in this patch, in Documentation/debugging-via-ohci1394.txt and I've put a copy online at ftp://ftp.suse.de/private/bk/firewire/docs/debugging-via-ohci1394.txt  It also has links to all the tools which are available to make use of it another copy of it is online at: ftp://ftp.suse.de/private/bk/firewire/kernel/ohci1394_dma_early-v2.diff  Signed-Off-By: Bernhard Kaindl <bk@suse.de> Tested-By: Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de> Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu> Signed-off-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

f | blk_types.h | s | 6.7K | 176 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1331065644 |  | block: implement bio_associate_current()  IO scheduling and cgroup are tied to the issuing task via io_context and cgroup of %current.  Unfortunately, there are cases where IOs need to be routed via a different task which makes scheduling and cgroup limit enforcement applied completely incorrectly.  For example, all bios delayed by blk-throttle end up being issued by a delayed work item and get assigned the io_context of the worker task which happens to serve the work item and dumped to the default block cgroup.  This is double confusing as bios which aren't delayed end up in the correct cgroup and makes using blk-throttle and cfq propio together impossible.  Any code which punts IO issuing to another task is affected which is getting more and more common (e.g. btrfs).  As both io_context and cgroup are firmly tied to task including userland visible APIs to manipulate them, it makes a lot of sense to match up tasks to bios.  This patch implements bio_associate_current() which associates the specified bio with %current.  The bio will record the associated ioc and blkcg at that point and block layer will use the recorded ones regardless of which task actually ends up issuing the bio.  bio release puts the associated ioc and blkcg.  It grabs and remembers ioc and blkcg instead of the task itself because task may already be dead by the time the bio is issued making ioc and blkcg inaccessible and those are all block layer cares about.  elevator_set_req_fn() is updated such that the bio elvdata is being allocated for is available to the elevator.  This doesn't update block cgroup policies yet.  Further patches will implement the support.  -v2: #ifdef CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP added around bio->bi_ioc dereference in      rq_ioc() to fix build breakage.

In the case of MIPI-DSI based video mode LCD Panel, for lcd power off, the power off commands should be transferred to lcd panel with display and mipi-dsi controller enabled because the commands is set to lcd panel at vsync porch period.  and in opposite case, the callback of fb driver should be called prior to lcd panel driver's one because of same issue.  Also if fb_blank mode is changed to FB_BLANK_POWERDOWN then display controller would be off(clock disable) but lcd panel would be still on.  at this time, you could see some issue like sparkling on lcd panel because video clock to be delivered to ldi module of lcd panel was disabled.  this issue could occurs for all lcd panels.  The callback order is as the following:  at fb_blank function of fbmem.c -> fb_notifier_call_chain(FB_EARLY_EVENT_BLANK)        -> lcd panel driver's early_set_power() -> info->fbops->fb_blank()        -> spcefic fb driver's fb_blank() -> fb_notifier_call_chain(FB_EVENT_BLANK)        -> lcd panel driver's set_power()    -> fb_notifier_call_chain(FB_R_EARLY_EVENT_BLANK) if info->fops->fb_blank() was failed.  fb_notifier_call_chain(FB_R_EARLY_EVENT_BLANK) would be called to revert the effects of previous FB_EARLY_EVENT_BLANK call.  and note that if early_set_power() of lcd_ops is NULL then early fb blank callback would be ignored.  This patch:  Add early_set_power and r_early_set_power callbacks.  early_set_power callback is called prior to fb_blank() of fbmem.c and r_early_set_power callback is called if fb_blank() was failed to revert the effects of the early_set_power call of lcd panel driver.

It's better not to do this with keyctl_revoke() as that marks the key to start returning -EKEYREVOKED to searches when what is actually desired is to have the key refetched.  To invalidate a key the caller must be granted SEARCH permission by the key. This may be too strict.  It may be better to also permit invalidation if the caller has any of READ, WRITE or SETATTR permission.

The second case in  in compat-64 mode looks like (variable names are as in include/net/iw_handler.h:iwe_stream_add_point()):   point_len = IW_EV_COMPAT_POINT_LEN = 8  lcp_len   = IW_EV_COMPAT_LCP_LEN   = 4  2nd memcpy: IW_EV_POINT_PK_LEN - IW_EV_LCP_PK_LEN = 12 - 4 = 8   IW_EV_LCP_PK_LEN  <-------------->                *---> 'extra' data area  +-------+-------+-------+-------+---------------+------- ...-+  || len   || cmd   ||length || flags ||  (empty) -> extra      ... ||  +-------+-------+-------+-------+---------------+------- ...-+     2       2       2       2          4       lcp_len  <-------------->                <-!!

The other two cases are -  * 32-bit systems: IW_EV_POINT_PK_LEN - IW_EV_LCP_PK_LEN =  8 - 4 = 4,    the second memcpy copies exactly the 4 required bytes;  * 64-bit systems: IW_EV_POINT_PK_LEN - IW_EV_LCP_PK_LEN = 12 - 4 = 8,    the second memcpy copies a superfluous (but non overlapping) 4 bytes.  The patch changes IW_EV_POINT_PK_LEN to be 8, so that in all 3 cases always only the requested iw_point.{length,flags} (both __u16) are copied, avoiding overrrun (compat-64) and superfluous copy (64-bit). In addition, the userspace header is sanitized (in agreement with version 30 of the wireless tools).  Many thanks to Johannes Berg for help and review with this patch.

I wrote a program to set fanotify_mark on "/tmp/block" and FAN_DENY all events notified.  fanotify_mask = FAN_ALL_EVENTS || FAN_ALL_PERM_EVENTS || FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD: $ cd /tmp/block; cat foo cat: foo: Operation not permitted  Operation on the file is blocked as expected.  But,  fanotify_mask = FAN_ALL_PERM_EVENTS || FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD: $ cd /tmp/block; cat foo aaa  It's not blocked anymore.  This is confusing behavior.  Also reading commit "fsnotify: call fsnotify_parent in perm events", it seems like fsnotify should handle subfiles' perm events as well as the other notify events.  With this patch, regardless of FAN_ALL_EVENTS set or not: $ cd /tmp/block; cat foo cat: foo: Operation not permitted  Operation on the file is now blocked properly.  FS_OPEN_PERM and FS_ACCESS_PERM are not listed on FS_EVENTS_POSS_ON_CHILD.  Due to fsnotify_inode_watches_children() check, if you only specify only these events as fsnotify_mask, you don't get subfiles' perm events notified.  This patch add the events to FS_EVENTS_POSS_ON_CHILD to get them notified even if only these events are specified to fsnotify_mask.

f | snmp.h | s | 10K | 262 | Eric Dumazet | eric.dumazet@gmail.com | 1332190388 |  | tcp: reduce out_of_order memory use  With increasing receive window sizes, but speed of light not improved that much, out of order queue can contain a huge number of skbs, waiting to be moved to receive_queue when missing packets can fill the holes.  Some devices happen to use fat skbs (truesize of 4096 + sizeof(struct sk_buff)) to store regular (MTU <= 1500) frames. This makes highly probable sk_rmem_alloc hits sk_rcvbuf limit, which can be 4Mbytes in many cases.  When limit is hit, tcp stack calls tcp_collapse_ofo_queue(), a true latency killer and cpu cache blower.  Doing the coalescing attempt each time we add a frame in ofo queue permits to keep memory use tight and in many cases avoid the tcp_collapse() thing later.  Tested on various wireless setups (b43, ath9k, ...) known to use big skb truesize, this patch removed the "packets collapsed in receive queue due to low socket buffer" I had before.  This also reduced average memory used by tcp sockets.  With help from Neal Cardwell.

f | oom.h | s | 1.9K | 62 | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1338333744 |  | mm, oom: normalize oom scores to oom_score_adj scale only for userspace  The oom_score_adj scale ranges from -1000 to 1000 and represents the proportion of memory available to the process at allocation time.  This means an oom_score_adj value of 300, for example, will bias a process as though it was using an extra 30.0% of available memory and a value of -350 will discount 35.0% of available memory from its usage.  The oom killer badness heuristic also uses this scale to report the oom score for each eligible process in determining the "best" process to kill.  Thus, it can only differentiate each process's memory usage by 0.1% of system RAM.  On large systems, this can end up being a large amount of memory: 256MB on 256GB systems, for example.  This can be fixed by having the badness heuristic to use the actual memory usage in scoring threads and then normalizing it to the oom_score_adj scale for userspace.  This results in better comparison between eligible threads for kill and no change from the userspace perspective.

f | watchdog.h | s | 6.6K | 162 | Hans de Goede | hdegoede@redhat.com | 1338357331 |  | watchdog: Add support for dynamically allocated watchdog_device structs  If a driver's watchdog_device struct is part of a dynamically allocated struct (which it often will be), merely locking the module is not enough, even with a drivers module locked, the driver can be unbound from the device, examples: 1) The root user can unbind it through sysfd 2) The i2c bus master driver being unloaded for an i2c watchdog  I will gladly admit that these are corner cases, but we still need to handle them correctly.  The fix for this consists of 2 parts: 1) Add ref / unref operations, so that the driver can refcount the struct    holding the watchdog_device struct and delay freeing it until any    open filehandles referring to it are closed 2) Most driver operations will do IO on the device and the driver should not    do any IO on the device after it has been unbound. Rather then letting each    driver deal with this internally, it is better to ensure at the watchdog    core level that no operations (other then unref) will get called after    the driver has called watchdog_unregister_device().

The Host used to create some page tables for the Guest to use at the top of Guest memory; it would then tell the Guest where this was.  In particular, it created linear mappings for 0 and 0xC0000000 addresses because lguest used to switch to its real page tables quite late in boot.  However, since d50d8fe19 Linux initialized boot page tables in head_32.S even before the "are we lguest?" boot jump.  So, now we can simplify things: the Host pagetable code assumes 1:1 linear mapping until it first calls the LHCALL_NEW_PGTABLE hypercall, which we now do before we reach C code.

f | bch.h | s | 2.6K | 72 | Ivan Djelic | ivan.djelic@parrot.com | 1299853550 |  | lib: add shared BCH ECC library  This is a new software BCH encoding/decoding library, similar to the shared Reed-Solomon library.  Binary BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) codes are widely used to correct errors in NAND flash devices requiring more than 1-bit ecc correction; they are generally better suited for NAND flash than RS codes because NAND bit errors do not occur in bursts. Latest SLC NAND devices typically require at least 4-bit ecc protection per 512 bytes block.  This library provides software encoding/decoding, but may also be used with ASIC/SoC hardware BCH engines to perform error correction. It is being currently used for this purpose on an OMAP3630 board (4bit/8bit HW BCH). It has also been used to decode raw dumps of NAND devices with on-die BCH ecc engines (e.g. Micron 4bit ecc SLC devices).  Latest NAND devices (including SLC) can exhibit high error rates (typically a dozen or more bitflips per hour during stress tests); in order to minimize the performance impact of error correction, this library implements recently developed algorithms for fast polynomial root finding (see bch.c header for details) instead of the traditional exhaustive Chien root search; a few performance figures are provided below:  Platform: arm926ejs @ 468 MHz, 32 KiB icache, 16 KiB dcache BCH ecc : 4-bit per 512 bytes  Encoding average throughput: 250 Mbits/s  Error correction time (compared with Chien search):          average   worst      average (Chien)  worst (Chien) ---------------------------------------------------------- 1 bit    8.5 µs   11 µs         200 µs           383 µs 2 bit    9.7 µs   12.5 µs       477 µs           728 µs 3 bit   18.1 µs   20.6 µs       758 µs          1010 µs 4 bit   19.5 µs   23 µs        1028 µs          1280 µs  In the above figures, "worst" is meant in terms of error pattern, not in terms of cache miss / page faults effects (not taken into account here).  The library has been extensively tested on the following platforms: x86, x86_64, arm926ejs, omap3630, qemu-ppc64, qemu-mips.

We model this as a set of virtual DMA channels, one for each request signal, and assign the virtual DMA channel to a physical DMA channel when there is work to be done.  This allows DMA users to claim their channels, and hold them while not in use, without affecting the availability of the physical channels.  Another advantage over this approach, compared to the private version, is that a channel can be reconfigured on the fly without having to release and re-request it - which for the IrDA driver, allows us to use DMA for SIR mode transmit without eating up three physical channels.  As IrDA is half-duplex, we actually only need one physical channel, and this architecture allows us to achieve that.  Signed-off-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>

Such an event becomes vital, if someone desires to control threads of a process in different manner.  A natural characteristic of threads is its comm value, and helpfully application developers have an opportunity to change it in runtime. Reporting about such events via proc connector allows to fine-grain monitoring and control potentials, for instance a process control daemon listening to proc connector and following comm value policies can place specific threads to assigned cgroup partitions.  It might be possible to achieve a pale partial one-shot likeness without this update, if an application changes comm value of a thread generator task beforehand, then a new thread is cloned, and after that proc connector listener gets the fork event and reads new thread's comm value from procfs stat file, but this change visibly simplifies and extends the matter.

To fix this, we do the following: 1. We add a new structure to mlx4_dev, mlx4_phys_caps, to contain physical HCA    capabilities.  The PPF uses the phys capabilities when it computes things    like ICM size.     The dev_caps structure will then contain the paravirtualized values, making    bookkeeping much easier in SRIOV mode. We add a structure rather than a    single parameter because there will be other fields in the phys_caps.     The first field we add to the mlx4_phys_caps structure is num_phys_eqs.  2. In INIT_HCA, when running in SRIOV mode, the "log_num_eqs" parameter    passed to the FW is the number of EQs per VF/PF; each function (PF or VF)    has this number of EQs available.     However, the total number of EQs which must be allowed for in the ICM is    (1 << log_num_eqs) * (#VFs + #PFs).  Rather than compute this quantity,    we allocate ICM space for 1024 EQs (which is the device maximum    number of EQs, and which is the value we place in the mlx4_phys_caps structure).     For INIT_HCA, however, we use the per-function number of EQs as described    above.

Each session corresponds to one or more connections obtained from that socket.  The number depends on the number of inputs/outputs of that particular type of operation.  For most types there will be a s ingle connection/file descriptor that is used for both input and output.  AEAD is one of the few that require two inputs.  Each algorithm type will provide its own implementation that plugs into af_alg.  They're keyed using a string such as "skcipher" or "hash".

There exist   more than one function for allocating and freeing the buffers:   currently these 3 are used dma_{alloc, free}_coherent,   dma_{alloc,free}_writecombine, dma_{alloc,free}_noncoherent.    For most of the systems these calls are almost equivalent and can be   interchanged.  For others, especially the truly non-coherent ones   (like ARM), the difference can be easily noticed in overall driver   performance.  Sadly not all architectures provide implementations for   all of them, so the drivers might need to be adapted and cannot be   easily shared between different architectures.  The provided patches   unify all these functions and hide the differences under the already   existing dma attributes concept.  The thread with more references is   available here:      http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sh/msg09777.html    These patches are also a prerequisite for unifying DMA-mapping   implementation on ARM architecture with the common one provided by   dma_map_ops structure and extending it with IOMMU support.  More   information is available in the following thread:      http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cross-arch/12819    More works on dma-mapping framework are planned, especially in the   area of buffer sharing and managing the shared mappings (together with   the recently introduced dma_buf interface: commit d15bd7ee445d   "dma-buf: Introduce dma buffer sharing mechanism").    The patches in the current set introduce a new alloc/free methods   (with support for memory attributes) in dma_map_ops structure, which   will later replace dma_alloc_coherent and dma_alloc_writecombine   functions."  People finally started piping up with support for merging this, so I'm merging it as the last of the pending stuff from the merge window.

The worst culprit was probably device.h since it is used everywhere. This file also had an implicit dependency/usage of mutex.h which was masked by module.h, and is also fixed here at the same time.  There are over a dozen other headers that simply declare the struct instead of pulling in the whole file, so follow their lead and simply make it a few more.

Worst of all it seems to vary between SLAB and SLUB.  So define a common maximum size for kmalloc.  For conveniences sake we use the maximum size ever supported which is 32 MB.  We limit the maximum size to a lower limit if MAX_ORDER does not allow such large allocations.  For many architectures this patch will have the effect of adding large kmalloc sizes.  x86_64 adds 5 new kmalloc sizes.  So a small amount of memory will be needed for these caches (contemporary SLAB has dynamically sizeable node and cpu structure so the waste is less than in the past)  Most architectures will then be able to allocate object with sizes up to MAX_ORDER.  We have had repeated breakage (in fact whenever we doubled the number of supported processors) on IA64 because one or the other struct grew beyond what the slab allocators supported.  This will avoid future issues and f.e.  avoid fixes for 2k and 4k cpu support.  CONFIG_LARGE_ALLOCS is no longer necessary so drop it.  It fixes sparc64 with SLAB.

This patch implements the feature by setting the outgoing interface in a similar fashion to that of IP_MULTICAST_IF.

SO_BINDTODEVICE: * SO_BINDTODEVICE requires administrative privileges, IP_UNICAST_IF does not.  From reading some old mailing list articles my understanding is that SO_BINDTODEVICE requires administrative privileges because it can override the administrator's routing settings. * The SO_BINDTODEVICE option restricts both outbound and inbound traffic, IP_UNICAST_IF only impacts outbound traffic.  IP_PKTINFO: * Since IP_PKTINFO and IP_UNICAST_IF are independent options, implementing IP_UNICAST_IF with IP_PKTINFO will likely break some applications. * Implementing IP_UNICAST_IF on top of IP_PKTINFO significantly complicates the Wine codebase and reduces the socket performance (doing this requires a lot of extra communication between the "server" and "user" layers).  bind(): * bind() does not work on broadcast packets, IP_UNICAST_IF is specifically intended to work with broadcast packets. * Like SO_BINDTODEVICE, bind() restricts both outbound and inbound traffic.

f | kcmp.h | s | 214B | 14 | Cyrill Gorcunov | gorcunov@openvz.org | 1338511772 |  | syscalls, x86: add __NR_kcmp syscall  While doing the checkpoint-restore in the user space one need to determine whether various kernel objects (like mm_struct-s of file_struct-s) are shared between tasks and restore this state.  The 2nd step can be solved by using appropriate CLONE_ flags and the unshare syscall, while there's currently no ways for solving the 1st one.  One of the ways for checking whether two tasks share e.g.  mm_struct is to provide some mm_struct ID of a task to its proc file, but showing such info considered to be not that good for security reasons.  Thus after some debates we end up in conclusion that using that named 'comparison' syscall might be the best candidate.  So here is it -- __NR_kcmp.  It takes up to 5 arguments - the pids of the two tasks (which characteristics should be compared), the comparison type and (in case of comparison of files) two file descriptors.  Lookups for pids are done in the caller's PID namespace only.  At moment only x86 is supported and tested.

f | rtnetlink.h | s | 20K | 668 | John Fastabend | john.r.fastabend@intel.com | 1334509564 |  | net: add generic PF_BRIDGE:RTM_ FDB hooks  This adds two new flags NTF_MASTER and NTF_SELF that can now be used to specify where PF_BRIDGE netlink commands should be sent. NTF_MASTER sends the commands to the 'dev->master' device for parsing. Typically this will be the linux net/bridge, or open-vswitch devices. Also without any flags set the command will be handled by the master device as well so that current user space tools continue to work as expected.  The NTF_SELF flag will push the PF_BRIDGE commands to the device. In the basic example below the commands are then parsed and programmed in the embedded bridge.  Note if both NTF_SELF and NTF_MASTER bits are set then the command will be sent to both 'dev->master' and 'dev' this allows user space to easily keep the embedded bridge and software bridge in sync.  There is a slight complication in the case with both flags set when an error occurs. To resolve this the rtnl handler clears the NTF_ flag in the netlink ack to indicate which sets completed successfully. The add/del handlers will abort as soon as any error occurs.  To support this new net device ops were added to call into the device and the existing bridging code was refactored to use these. There should be no required changes in user space to support the current bridge behavior.  A basic setup with a SR-IOV enabled NIC looks like this,            veth0  veth2             ||      ||           ------------           ||  bridge0 ||   <---- software bridging           ------------                /                /   ethx.y      ethx     VF         PF      \         \          <---- propagate FDB entries to HW      \         \   --------------------   ||  Embedded Bridge ||    <---- hardware offloaded switching   --------------------  In this case the embedded bridge must be managed to allow 'veth0' to communicate with 'ethx.y' correctly. At present drivers managing the embedded bridge either send frames onto the network which then get dropped by the switch OR the embedded bridge will flood these frames. With this patch we have a mechanism to manage the embedded bridge correctly from user space. This example is specific to SR-IOV but replacing the VF with another PF or dropping this into the DSA framework generates similar management issues.

But it can only export it in debugfs root directory.  Per Forlin is working on mmc_fail_request which adds support to inject data errors after a completed host transfer in MMC subsystem.  The fault_attr for mmc_fail_request should be defined per mmc host and export it in debugfs directory per mmc host like /sys/kernel/debug/mmc0/mmc_fail_request.  init_fault_attr_dentries() doesn't help for mmc_fail_request.  So this introduces fault_create_debugfs_attr() which is able to create a directory in the arbitrary directory and replace init_fault_attr_dentries().

The idea is, before calling the lockdep code, do a load_idt() to the special IDT that kept the breakpoint stack from reseting. This worked well as a quick fix for this kernel release, until a certain config caused a lockup in the function tracer start up tests.  Investigating it, I found that the load_idt that was used to prevent the int3 from changing stacks was itself being traced!  Even though the config had CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING disabled, and all 'inline' tags were set to always inline, there were still cases that it did not inline! This was caused by CONFIG_PARAVIRT_GUEST, where it would add a pointer to the native_load_idt() which made that function to be traced.  Commit 45959ee7aa645815a ("ftrace: Do not function trace inlined functions") only touched the 'inline' tags when CONFIG_OPMITIZE_INLINING was enabled. PARAVIRT_GUEST shows that this was not enough and we need to also mark always_inline with notrace as well.

It ignores ep_unregister_pollwait() which plays with the same wqh. See the next change.  epoll assumes that the EPOLL_CTL_ADD'ed file controls everything f_op->poll() needs. In particular it assumes that the wait queue can't go away until eventpoll_release(). This is not true in case of signalfd, the task which does EPOLL_CTL_ADD uses its ->sighand which is not connected to the file.  This patch adds the special event, POLLFREE, currently only for epoll. It expects that init_poll_funcptr()'ed hook should do the necessary cleanup. Perhaps it should be defined as EPOLLFREE in eventpoll.  __cleanup_sighand() is changed to do wake_up_poll(POLLFREE) if ->signalfd_wqh is not empty, we add the new signalfd_cleanup() helper.  ep_poll_callback(POLLFREE) simply does list_del_init(task_list). This make this poll entry inconsistent, but we don't care. If you share epoll fd which contains our sigfd with another process you should blame yourself. signalfd is "really special". I simply do not know how we can define the "right" semantics if it used with epoll.  The main problem is, epoll calls signalfd_poll() once to establish the connection with the wait queue, after that signalfd_poll(NULL) returns the different/inconsistent results depending on who does EPOLL_CTL_MOD/signalfd_read/etc. IOW: apart from sigmask, signalfd has nothing to do with the file, it works with the current thread.  In short: this patch is the hack which tries to fix the symptoms. It also assumes that nobody can take tasklist_lock under epoll locks, this seems to be true.  Note:  	- we do not have wake_up_all_poll() but wake_up_poll() 	  is fine, poll/epoll doesn't use WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE.  	- signalfd_cleanup() uses POLLHUP along with POLLFREE, 	  we need a couple of simple changes in eventpoll.c to 	  make sure it can't be "lost".

These describe the platform devices present including SPI and I²C devices, as well as various sensors, keypads and other glue as well as interfaces provided via the SCU IPC mechanism (intel_scu_ipc.c)  This patch is a merge of the core elements and relevant fixes from the Intel development code by Feng, Alek, myself into a single coherent patch for upstream submission.  It provides the needed infrastructure to register I2C, SPI and platform devices described by the tables, as well as handlers for some of the hardware already supported in kernel. The 0.8 firmware also provides GPIO tables.  Devices are created at boot time or if they are SCU dependant at the point an SCU is discovered. The existing Linux device mechanisms will then handle the device binding. At an abstract level this is an SFI to Linux device translator.  Device/platform specific setup/glue is in this file. This is done so that the drivers for the generic I²C and SPI bus devices remain cross platform as they should.

f | taskstats.h | s | 6.8K | 179 | Jeff Mahoney | jeffm@suse.com | 1293075814 |  | taskstats: pad taskstats netlink response for aligment issues on ia64  The taskstats structure is internally aligned on 8 byte boundaries but the layout of the aggregrate reply, with two NLA headers and the pid (each 4 bytes), actually force the entire structure to be unaligned.  This causes the kernel to issue unaligned access warnings on some architectures like ia64.  Unfortunately, some software out there doesn't properly unroll the NLA packet and assumes that the start of the taskstats structure will always be 20 bytes from the start of the netlink payload.  Aligning the start of the taskstats structure breaks this software, which we don't want.  So, for now the alignment only happens on architectures that require it and those users will have to update to fixed versions of those packages.  Space is reserved in the packet only when needed.  This ifdef should be removed in several years e.g.  2012 once we can be confident that fixed versions are installed on most systems.  We add the padding before the aggregate since the aggregate is already a defined type.  Commit 85893120 ("delayacct: align to 8 byte boundary on 64-bit systems") previously addressed the alignment issues by padding out the pid field. This was supposed to be a compatible change but the circumstances described above mean that it wasn't.  This patch backs out that change, since it was a hack, and introduces a new NULL attribute type to provide the padding.  Padding the response with 4 bytes avoids allocating an aligned taskstats structure and copying it back.  Since the structure weighs in at 328 bytes, it's too big to do it on the stack.

In the exit path this callback gets called in unlink_file_vma(). However by the time unlink_file_vma() is called, the pages would have been unmapped (in unmap_vmas()) and the task->rss_stat counts accounted (in zap_pte_range()).  If the exiting process has probepoints, uprobe_munmap() checks if the breakpoint instruction was around before decrementing the probe count.  This results in a file backed page being reread by uprobe_munmap() and hence it does not find the breakpoint.  This patch fixes this problem by moving the callback to unmap_single_vma(). Since unmap_single_vma() may not unmap the complete vma, add start and end parameters to uprobe_munmap().  This bug became apparent courtesy of commit c3f0327f8e9d ("mm: add rss counters consistency check").

f | usb_usual.h | s | 3.3K | 88 | Alan Stern | stern@rowland.harvard.edu | 1307462742 |  | usb-storage: redo incorrect reads  Some USB mass-storage devices have bugs that cause them not to handle the first READ(10) command they receive correctly.  The Corsair Padlock v2 returns completely bogus data for its first read (possibly it returns the data in encrypted form even though the device is supposed to be unlocked).  The Feiya SD/SDHC card reader fails to complete the first READ(10) command after it is plugged in or after a new card is inserted, returning a status code that indicates it thinks the command was invalid, which prevents the kernel from retrying the read.  Since the first read of a new device or a new medium is for the partition sector, the kernel is unable to retrieve the device's partition table.  Users have to manually issue an "hdparm -z" or "blockdev --rereadpt" command before they can access the device.  This patch (as1470) works around the problem.  It adds a new quirk flag, US_FL_INVALID_READ10, indicating that the first READ(10) should always be retried immediately, as should any failing READ(10) commands (provided the preceding READ(10) command succeeded, to avoid getting stuck in a loop).  The patch also adds appropriate unusual_devs entries containing the new flag.

This includes:  (1) makes available core swap data structures (swap_lock, swap_list and swap_info) that are needed by frontswap.c but we don't need to expose them to the dozens of files that include swap.h so we create a new swapfile.h just to extern-ify these and modify their declarations to non-static  (2) adds frontswap-related elements to swap_info_struct.  Frontswap_map points to vzalloc'ed one-bit-per-swap-page metadata that indicates whether the swap page is in frontswap or in the device and frontswap_pages counts how many pages are in frontswap.  (3) adds hooks in the swap subsystem and extends try_to_unuse so that frontswap_shrink can do a "partial swapoff".  Note that a failed frontswap_map allocation is safe... failure is noted by lack of "FS" in the subsequent printk.  ---  [v14: rebase to 3.4-rc2] [v10: no change] [v9: akpm@linux-foundation.org: mark some statics __read_mostly] [v9: akpm@linux-foundation.org: add clarifying comments] [v9: akpm@linux-foundation.org: no need to loop repeating try_to_unuse] [v9: error27@gmail.com: remove superfluous check for NULL] [v8: rebase to 3.0-rc4] [v8: kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com: change counter to atomic_t to avoid races] [v8: kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com: comment to clarify informational counters] [v7: rebase to 3.0-rc3] [v7: JBeulich@novell.com: add new swap struct elements only if config'd] [v6: rebase to 3.0-rc1] [v6: lliubbo@gmail.com: fix null pointer deref if vzalloc fails] [v6: konrad.wilk@oracl.com: various checks and code clarifications/comments] [v5: no change from v4] [v4: rebase to 2.6.39] Signed-off-by: Dan Magenheimer <dan.magenheimer@oracle.com> Reviewed-by: Kamezawa Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com> Acked-by: Jan Beulich <JBeulich@novell.com> Acked-by: Seth Jennings <sjenning@linux.vnet.ibm.com> Cc: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org> Cc: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com> Cc: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org> Cc: Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org> Cc: Matthew Wilcox <matthew@wil.cx> Cc: Chris Mason <chris.mason@oracle.com> Cc: Rik Riel <riel@redhat.com> Cc: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org> [v11: Rebased, fixed mm/swapfile.c context change] Signed-off-by: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>

When a tracer specifies the PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP ptrace option, the tracer will be notified, via PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP, for any syscall that results in a BPF program returning SECCOMP_RET_TRACE.  The 16-bit SECCOMP_RET_DATA mask of the BPF program return value will be passed as the ptrace_message and may be retrieved using PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.  If the subordinate process is not using seccomp filter, then no system call notifications will occur even if the option is specified.  If there is no tracer with PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP when SECCOMP_RET_TRACE is returned, the system call will not be executed and an -ENOSYS errno will be returned to userspace.  This change adds a dependency on the system call slow path.  Any future efforts to use the system call fast path for seccomp filter will need to address this restriction.

f | pci-aspm.h | s | 1.8K | 64 | Matthew Garrett | mjg@redhat.com | 1323109305 |  | PCI: Rework ASPM disable code  Right now we forcibly clear ASPM state on all devices if the BIOS indicates that the feature isn't supported. Based on the Microsoft presentation "PCI Express In Depth for Windows Vista and Beyond", I'm starting to think that this may be an error. The implication is that unless the platform grants full control via _OSC, Windows will not touch any PCIe features - including ASPM. In that case clearing ASPM state would be an error unless the platform has granted us that control.  This patch reworks the ASPM disabling code such that the actual clearing of state is triggered by a successful handoff of PCIe control to the OS. The general ASPM code undergoes some changes in order to ensure that the ability to clear the bits isn't overridden by ASPM having already been disabled. Further, this theoretically now allows for situations where only a subset of PCIe roots hand over control, leaving the others in the BIOS state.  It's difficult to know for sure that this is the right thing to do - there's zero public documentation on the interaction between all of these components. But enough vendors enable ASPM on platforms and then set this bit that it seems likely that they're expecting the OS to leave them alone.  Measured to save around 5W on an idle Thinkpad X220.

Similarly, LZMA Utils was superseded by XZ Utils.  These patches add support for XZ decompression into the kernel.  Most of the code is as is from XZ Embedded <http://tukaani.org/xz/embedded.html>. It was written for the Linux kernel but is usable in other projects too.  Advantages of XZ over the current LZMA code in the kernel:   - Nice API that can be used by other kernel modules; it's     not limited to kernel, initramfs, and initrd decompression.   - Integrity check support (CRC32)   - BCJ filters improve compression of executable code on     certain architectures. These together with LZMA2 can     produce a few percent smaller kernel or Squashfs images     than plain LZMA without making the decompression slower.  This patch: Add the main decompression code (xz_dec), testing module (xz_dec_test), wrapper script (xz_wrap.sh) for the xz command line tool, and documentation.  The xz_dec module is enough to have a usable XZ decompressor e.g.  for Squashfs.  Signed-off-by: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org> Cc: "H.

(Typical load on a dual processor machine where network interrupts are handled by one particular CPU (allocating skbufs), and the other CPU is running the application (consuming and freeing skbufs))  Here on one production server (dual-core AMD Opteron 285), I noticed this divide took 1.20 % of CPU_CLK_UNHALTED events in kernel.  But Opteron are quite modern cpus and the divide is much more expensive on oldest architectures :  On a 200 MHz sparcv9 machine, the division takes 64 cycles instead of 1 cycle for a multiply.  Doing some math, we can use a reciprocal multiplication instead of a divide.  If we want to compute V = (A / B)  (A and B being u32 quantities) we can instead use :  V = ((u64)A * RECIPROCAL(B)) >> 32 ;  where RECIPROCAL(B) is precalculated to ((1LL << 32) + (B - 1)) / B  Note :  I wrote pure C code for clarity. gcc output for i386 is not optimal but acceptable :  mull   0x14(%ebx) mov    %edx,%eax // part of the >> 32 xor     %edx,%edx // useless mov    %eax,(%esp) // could be avoided mov    %edx,0x4(%esp) // useless mov    (%esp),%ebx  [akpm@osdl.org: small cleanups] Signed-off-by: Eric Dumazet <dada1@cosmosbay.com> Cc: Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com> Cc: David Miller <davem@davemloft.net> Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org> Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>

f | static_key.h | s | 30B | 1 | Ingo Molnar | mingo@elte.hu | 1330074359 |  | static keys: Introduce 'struct static_key', static_key_true()/false() and static_key_slow_[inc||dec]()  So here's a boot tested patch on top of Jason's series that does all the cleanups I talked about and turns jump labels into a more intuitive to use facility. It should also address the various misconceptions and confusions that surround jump labels.  Typical usage scenarios:          #include <linux/static_key.h>          struct static_key key = STATIC_KEY_INIT_TRUE;          if (static_key_false(&key))                 do unlikely code         else                 do likely code  Or:          if (static_key_true(&key))                 do likely code         else                 do unlikely code  The static key is modified via:          static_key_slow_inc(&key);         ...         static_key_slow_dec(&key);  The 'slow' prefix makes it abundantly clear that this is an expensive operation.  I've updated all in-kernel code to use this everywhere. Note that I (intentionally) have not pushed through the rename blindly through to the lowest levels: the actual jump-label patching arch facility should be named like that, so we want to decouple jump labels from the static-key facility a bit.  On non-jump-label enabled architectures static keys default to likely()/unlikely() branches.

The actual space consumed may be less than the size (RTC_IO_EXTENT) assumed by the RTC driver.  The PNP core doesn't request resources yet, but I'd like to make it do so. If/when it does, the RTC_IO_EXTENT request may fail, which prevents the RTC driver from loading.  Since we only use the RTC index and data registers at RTC_PORT(0) and RTC_PORT(1), we can fall back to requesting just enough space for those.  If the PNP core requests resources, this results in typical I/O port usage like this:      0070-0073 : 00:06		<-- PNP device 00:06 responds to 70-73       0070-0071 : rtc		<-- RTC driver uses only 70-71  instead of the current:      0070-0077 : rtc		<-- RTC_IO_EXTENT == 8  Signed-off-by: Bjorn Helgaas <bjorn.helgaas@hp.com> Cc: Alessandro Zummo <a.zummo@towertech.it> Cc: David Brownell <david-b@pacbell.net> Cc: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org> Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org> Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

Replace that build-time scheme with a load-time module parameter: "7300_idle.forceload=1" to make it easier to test the driver on hardware that while not officially validated, works fine and is much more commonly available.  By default (no modparam) the driver will continue to load only on the i7300.  Note that ioat_dma runs a copy of i7300_idle's probe routine to know to reserve an IOAT channel for i7300_idle.

The worst culprit was probably device.h since it is used everywhere. This file also had an implicit dependency/usage of mutex.h which was masked by module.h, and is also fixed here at the same time.  There are over a dozen other headers that simply declare the struct instead of pulling in the whole file, so follow their lead and simply make it a few more.  Most of the implicit dependencies on module.h being present by these headers pulling it in have been now weeded out, so we can finally make this change with hopefully minimal breakage.

This results in a huge autoconf.h file, on the order of 16k lines for a x86_64 defconfig.  Fixing IS_ENABLED to be able to work on the smaller subset of just things that we really have defined is step one to fixing this.  Which means it has to not choke when fed non-enabled options, such as:    include/linux/netdevice.h:964:1: warning: "__enabled_CONFIG_FCOE_MODULE" is not defined [-Wundef]  The original prototype of how to implement a C and preprocessor compatible way of doing this came from the Google+ user "comex ." in response to Linus' crowdsourcing challenge for a possible improvement on his earlier C specific solution:  	#define config_enabled(x)       (__stringify(x)[0] == '1')  In this implementation, I've chosen variable names that hopefully make how it works more understandable.

Clean up the users as follows:  1) For those headers only needing "struct device" as a pointer in fcn args, replace the include with exactly that.  2) For headers not really using anything from device.h, simply delete the include altogether.  3) For headers relying on getting device.h implicitly before being included themselves, now explicitly include device.h  4) For files in which doing #1 or #2 uncovers an implicit dependency on some other header, fix by explicitly adding the required header(s).  Any C files that were implicitly relying on device.h to be present have already been dealt with in advance.  Total removals from #1 and #2: 51.  Total additions coming from #3: 9.  Total other implicit dependencies from #4: 7.  As of 3.3-rc1, there were 110, so a net removal of 42 gives about a 38% reduction in device.h presence in include/*  Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>

This leaves the problem of cleaning up the lock state in userspace.  This has three parts:  1. Add a flag to unlock operations sent to userspace indicating the file is being closed.  Userspace will then look for and clear any waiting plock operations that were abandoned by an interrupted process.  2. Queue an unlock-close operation (like in 1) to clean up userspace from an interrupted plock request.  This is needed because the vfs will not send a cleanup-unlock if it sees no locks on the file, which it won't if the interrupted operation was the only one.  3. Do not use replies from userspace for unlock-close operations because they are unnecessary (they are just cleaning up for the process which did not make an unlock call).  This also simplifies the new unlock-close generated from point 2.  Signed-off-by: David Teigland <teigland@redhat.com>

Although in most cases the global clock provides this functionality, if timings is not the issue, it is more comforting to know that the order of events really happened in a precise order.  Instead of using a clock, add a "counter" that is simply an incrementing atomic 64bit counter that orders the events as they are perceived to happen.  The trace_clock_counter() is added from the attempt by Peter Zijlstra trying to convert the trace_clock_global() to it. I took Peter's counter code and made trace_clock_counter() instead, and added it to the choice of clocks. Just echo counter > /debug/tracing/trace_clock to activate it.

f | hardirq.h | s | 5.7K | 177 | Paul E. McKenney | paul.mckenney@linaro.org | 1323628284 |  | rcu: Track idleness independent of idle tasks  Earlier versions of RCU used the scheduling-clock tick to detect idleness by checking for the idle task, but handled idleness differently for CONFIG_NO_HZ=y.  But there are now a number of uses of RCU read-side critical sections in the idle task, for example, for tracing.  A more fine-grained detection of idleness is therefore required.  This commit presses the old dyntick-idle code into full-time service, so that rcu_idle_enter(), previously known as rcu_enter_nohz(), is always invoked at the beginning of an idle loop iteration.  Similarly, rcu_idle_exit(), previously known as rcu_exit_nohz(), is always invoked at the end of an idle-loop iteration.  This allows the idle task to use RCU everywhere except between consecutive rcu_idle_enter() and rcu_idle_exit() calls, in turn allowing architecture maintainers to specify exactly where in the idle loop that RCU may be used.  Because some of the userspace upcall uses can result in what looks to RCU like half of an interrupt, it is not possible to expect that the irq_enter() and irq_exit() hooks will give exact counts.  This patch therefore expands the ->dynticks_nesting counter to 64 bits and uses two separate bitfields to count process/idle transitions and interrupt entry/exit transitions.  It is presumed that userspace upcalls do not happen in the idle loop or from usermode execution (though usermode might do a system call that results in an upcall). The counter is hard-reset on each process/idle transition, which avoids the interrupt entry/exit error from accumulating.  Overflow is avoided by the 64-bitness of the ->dyntick_nesting counter.  This commit also adds warnings if a non-idle task asks RCU to enter idle state (and these checks will need some adjustment before applying Frederic's OS-jitter patches (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/7/246). In addition, validation of ->dynticks and ->dynticks_nesting is added.  Signed-off-by: Paul E. McKenney <paul.mckenney@linaro.org> Signed-off-by: Paul E.

f | ioc3.h | s | 3.1K | 83 | David Howells | dhowells@redhat.com | 1160057412 |  | IRQ: Maintain regs pointer globally rather than passing to IRQ handlers  Maintain a per-CPU global "struct pt_regs *" variable which can be used instead of passing regs around manually through all ~1800 interrupt handlers in the Linux kernel.  The regs pointer is used in few places, but it potentially costs both stack space and code to pass it around.  On the FRV arch, removing the regs parameter from all the genirq function results in a 20% speed up of the IRQ exit path (ie: from leaving timer_interrupt() to leaving do_IRQ()).  Where appropriate, an arch may override the generic storage facility and do something different with the variable.  On FRV, for instance, the address is maintained in GR28 at all times inside the kernel as part of general exception handling.  Having looked over the code, it appears that the parameter may be handed down through up to twenty or so layers of functions.  Consider a USB character device attached to a USB hub, attached to a USB controller that posts its interrupts through a cascaded auxiliary interrupt controller.  A character device driver may want to pass regs to the sysrq handler through the input layer which adds another few layers of parameter passing.  I've build this code with allyesconfig for x86_64 and i386.  I've runtested the main part of the code on FRV and i386, though I can't test most of the drivers. I've also done partial conversion for powerpc and MIPS - these at least compile with minimal configurations.  This will affect all archs.  Mostly the changes should be relatively easy. Take do_IRQ(), store the regs pointer at the beginning, saving the old one:  	struct pt_regs *old_regs = set_irq_regs(regs);  And put the old one back at the end:  	set_irq_regs(old_regs);  Don't pass regs through to generic_handle_irq() or __do_IRQ().  In timer_interrupt(), this sort of change will be necessary:  	-	update_process_times(user_mode(regs)); 	-	profile_tick(CPU_PROFILING, regs); 	+	update_process_times(user_mode(get_irq_regs())); 	+	profile_tick(CPU_PROFILING);  I'd like to move update_process_times()'s use of get_irq_regs() into itself, except that i386, alone of the archs, uses something other than user_mode().  Some notes on the interrupt handling in the drivers:   (*) input_dev() is now gone entirely.  The regs pointer is no longer stored in      the input_dev struct.   (*) finish_unlinks() in drivers/usb/host/ohci-q.c needs checking.  It does      something different depending on whether it's been supplied with a regs      pointer or not.   (*) Various IRQ handler function pointers have been moved to type      irq_handler_t.

The nfs_match_client() reference from nfs4_set_ds_client bumps the cl_count, the nfs_client is not freed at umount, and nfs4_deviceid_purge_client is not called to dereference the MDS usage of a deviceid which holds a reference to the DS nfs_client.  The result is the umount program returns, but the nfs_client is not freed, and the cl_session hearbeat continues.  The MDS (and all other nfs mounts) lose their last nfs_client reference in nfs_free_server when the last nfs_server (fsid) is umounted. The file layout DS lose their last nfs_client reference in destroy_ds when the last deviceid referencing the data server is put and destroy_ds is called. This is triggered by a call to nfs4_deviceid_purge_client which removes references to a pNFS deviceid used by an MDS mount.  The fix is to track how many pnfs enabled filesystems are mounted from this server, and then to purge the device id cache once that count reaches zero.

However, it overlooked the s2disk code path in which the SNAPSHOT_CREATE_IMAGE ioctl was run directly after SNAPSHOT_FREE, which caused freeze_workqueues_begin() to BUG(), because it saw that worqueues had been already frozen.  Although in principle this issue might be addressed by removing the relevant BUG_ON() from freeze_workqueues_begin(), that would reintroduce the very problem that commit 2aede851ddf08666f68ffc17be4 attempted to avoid into that particular code path.

Since i8042 nor serio subsystem are not aware of the details of the PS/2 protocol (length of the commands and their replies and so on) the locking should be done on libps2 level by adding special handling when we see that we are dealing with serio port on i8042.

As long as there were no hard linked files that crossed from one subtree to another, this was quite safe. Post the changes, if the two directories are on the same filesystem (have the same 'fsid'), they will share the same super block, and hence the same mount options.  Add a flag to allow users to elect not to share the NFS super block with another mount point, even if the fsids are the same. This will allow users to set different mount options for the two different super blocks, as was previously possible. It is still up to the user to ensure that there are no cache coherency issues when doing this, however the default behaviour will be to share super blocks whenever two paths result in the same fsid.

Clean up the users as follows:  1) For those headers only needing "struct device" as a pointer in fcn args, replace the include with exactly that.  2) For headers not really using anything from device.h, simply delete the include altogether.  3) For headers relying on getting device.h implicitly before being included themselves, now explicitly include device.h  4) For files in which doing #1 or #2 uncovers an implicit dependency on some other header, fix by explicitly adding the required header(s).  Any C files that were implicitly relying on device.h to be present have already been dealt with in advance.  Total removals from #1 and #2: 51.  Total additions coming from #3: 9.  Total other implicit dependencies from #4: 7.  As of 3.3-rc1, there were 110, so a net removal of 42 gives about a 38% reduction in device.h presence in include/*  Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>

There is no support for DMA on the generic bus interface it self, a state machine inside the FPGA is handling RX and TX transfers to/from buffers in the FPGA. The host CPU can do DMA to and from these buffers.  The FPGA has to handle the RX interrupts, so these must be enabled in the ks8842 but not in the FPGA. The driver must not disable the RX interrupt that would mean that the data transfers into the FPGA buffers would stop.  The host shall not enable TX interrupts since TX is handled by the FPGA, the host is notified by DMA callbacks when transfers are finished.  Which DMA channels to use are added as parameters in the platform data struct.  Signed-off-by: Richard Röjfors <richard.rojfors@pelagicore.com> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

McKenney | paul.mckenney@linaro.org | 1339040608 |  | rcu: Precompute RCU_FAST_NO_HZ timer offsets  When a CPU is entering dyntick-idle mode, tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() calls rcu_needs_cpu() see if RCU needs that CPU, and, if not, computes the next wakeup time based on the timer wheels.  Only later, when actually entering the idle loop, rcu_prepare_for_idle() will be invoked.  In some cases, rcu_prepare_for_idle() will post timers to wake the CPU back up. But all for naught: The next wakeup time for the CPU has already been computed, and posting a timer afterwards does not force that wakeup time to be recomputed.  This means that rcu_prepare_for_idle()'s have no effect.  This is not a problem on a busy system because something else will wake up the CPU soon enough.  However, on lightly loaded systems, the CPU might stay asleep for a considerable length of time.  If that CPU has a callback that the rest of the system is waiting on, the system might run very slowly or (in theory) even hang.  This commit avoids this problem by having rcu_needs_cpu() give tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() an estimate of when RCU will need the CPU to wake back up, which tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() takes into account when programming the CPU's wakeup time.  An alternative approach is for rcu_prepare_for_idle() to use hrtimers instead of normal timers, but timers are much more efficient than are hrtimers for frequently and repeatedly posting and cancelling a given timer, which is exactly what RCU_FAST_NO_HZ does.

The problem arises because lockdep is unable to deal with the tree-structured locks created by the device core and sysfs.  This particular problem involves a sysfs attribute method that unregisters itself, not from the device it was called for, but from a descendant device.  Lockdep doesn't understand the distinction and reports a possible deadlock, even though the operation is safe.  This is the sort of thing that would normally be handled by using a nested lock annotation; unfortunately it's not feasible to do that here.  There's no sensible way to tell sysfs when attribute removal occurs in the context of a parent attribute method.  As a workaround, the patch adds a new flag to struct attribute telling sysfs not to inform lockdep when it acquires a readlock on a sysfs_dirent instance for the attribute.  The readlock is still acquired, but lockdep doesn't know about it and hence does not complain about impossible deadlock scenarios.  Also added are macros for static initialization of attribute structures with the ignore_lockdep flag set.  The three offending attributes in the USB subsystem are converted to use the new macros.

Because it's permissible to free a work_struct from its callout function, the map used is an onstack copy of the map given in the work_struct: and that copy is made without any locking.  Surprisingly, gcc (4.5.1 in Hugh's case) uses "rep movsl" rather than "rep movsq" for that structure copy: which might race with a workqueue user's wait_on_work() doing lock_map_acquire() on the source of the copy, putting a pointer into the class_cache[], but only in time for the top half of that pointer to be copied to the destination map.  Boom when process_one_work() subsequently does lock_map_acquire() on its onstack copy of the lockdep_map.  Fix this, and a similar instance in call_timer_fn(), with a lockdep_copy_map() function which additionally NULLs the class_cache[].  Note: this oops was actually seen on 3.4-next, where flush_work() newly does the racing lock_map_acquire(); but Tejun points out that 3.4 and earlier are already vulnerable to the same through wait_on_work().  * Patch orginally from Peter.

The final goal is to get rid of the 'sync_supers()' kernel thread.  This kernel thread wakes up every 5 seconds (by default) and calls '->write_super()' for all mounted file-systems.  And the bad thing is that this is done even if all the superblocks are clean.  Moreover, some file-systems do not even need this end they do not register the '->write_super()' method at all (e.g., btrfs).  So 'sync_supers()' most often just generates useless wake-ups and wastes power.  I am trying to make all file-systems independent of '->write_super()' and plan to remove 'sync_supers()' and '->write_super' completely once there are no more users.  The '->write_supers()' method is mostly used by baroque file-systems like hfs, udf, etc.  Modern file-systems like btrfs and xfs do not use it. This justifies removing this stuff from VFS completely and make every FS self-manage own superblock.  Tested with xfstests.  This patch:  Preparation for further changes.  It introduces a special inode ('fsinfo_inode') in FAT file-system which we'll later use for managing the FSINFO block.  Note, this there is already one special inode ('fat_inode') which is used for managing the FAT tables.  Introduce new 'MSDOS_FSINFO_INO' constant for this special inode.  It is safe to do because FAT file-system does not store inode numbers on the media but generates them run-time.  I've also cleaned up the comment to existing 'MSDOS_ROOT_INO' constant, while on it.

Unfortunately, there are cases where IOs need to be routed via a different task which makes scheduling and cgroup limit enforcement applied completely incorrectly.  For example, all bios delayed by blk-throttle end up being issued by a delayed work item and get assigned the io_context of the worker task which happens to serve the work item and dumped to the default block cgroup.  This is double confusing as bios which aren't delayed end up in the correct cgroup and makes using blk-throttle and cfq propio together impossible.  Any code which punts IO issuing to another task is affected which is getting more and more common (e.g. btrfs).  As both io_context and cgroup are firmly tied to task including userland visible APIs to manipulate them, it makes a lot of sense to match up tasks to bios.  This patch implements bio_associate_current() which associates the specified bio with %current.  The bio will record the associated ioc and blkcg at that point and block layer will use the recorded ones regardless of which task actually ends up issuing the bio.  bio release puts the associated ioc and blkcg.  It grabs and remembers ioc and blkcg instead of the task itself because task may already be dead by the time the bio is issued making ioc and blkcg inaccessible and those are all block layer cares about.  elevator_set_req_fn() is updated such that the bio elvdata is being allocated for is available to the elevator.  This doesn't update block cgroup policies yet.  Further patches will implement the support.  -v2: #ifdef CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP added around bio->bi_ioc dereference in      rq_ioc() to fix build breakage.

f | task_work.h | s | 748B | 26 | Oleg Nesterov | oleg@redhat.com | 1337825361 |  | task_work_add: generic process-context callbacks  Provide a simple mechanism that allows running code in the (nonatomic) context of the arbitrary task.  The caller does task_work_add(task, task_work) and this task executes task_work->func() either from do_notify_resume() or from do_exit().  The callback can rely on PF_EXITING to detect the latter case.  "struct task_work" can be embedded in another struct, still it has "void *data" to handle the most common/simple case.  This allows us to kill the ->replacement_session_keyring hack, and potentially this can have more users.  Performance-wise, this adds 2 "unlikely(!hlist_empty())" checks into tracehook_notify_resume() and do_exit().  But at the same time we can remove the "replacement_session_keyring != NULL" checks from arch/*/signal.c and exit_creds().  Note: task_work_add/task_work_run abuses ->pi_lock.  This is only because this lock is already used by lookup_pi_state() to synchronize with do_exit() setting PF_EXITING.  Fortunately the scope of this lock in task_work.c is really tiny, and the code is unlikely anyway.

But because RCU readers do not exclude updaters, a list might become empty between the time that list_empty() claimed it was non-empty and the time that list_first_entry_rcu() is invoked.  Therefore, the list_empty() test cannot be separated from the list_first_entry_rcu() call.  This commit therefore combines these to macros to create a new list_first_or_null_rcu() macro that replaces the old (and unsafe) list_first_entry_rcu() macro.  This patch incorporates Paul's review comments on the previous version of this patch available here:  https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/2/536  This patch cannot break any upstream code because list_first_entry_rcu() is not being used anywhere in the kernel (tested with grep(1)), and any external code using it is probably broken as a result of using it.

First one is Contiguous Memory   Allocator (CMA) which makes it possible for device drivers to allocate   big contiguous chunks of memory after the system has booted.    The main difference from the similar frameworks is the fact that CMA   allows to transparently reuse the memory region reserved for the big   chunk allocation as a system memory, so no memory is wasted when no   big chunk is allocated.  Once the alloc request is issued, the   framework migrates system pages to create space for the required big   chunk of physically contiguous memory.    For more information one can refer to nice LWN articles:     - 'A reworked contiguous memory allocator': 		http://lwn.net/Articles/447405/     - 'CMA and ARM': 		http://lwn.net/Articles/450286/     - 'A deep dive into CMA': 		http://lwn.net/Articles/486301/     - and the following thread with the patches and links to all previous      versions: 		https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/3/204    The main client for this new framework is ARM DMA-mapping subsystem.    The second part provides a complete redesign in ARM DMA-mapping   subsystem.  The core implementation has been changed to use common   struct dma_map_ops based infrastructure with the recent updates for   new dma attributes merged in v3.4-rc2.  This allows to use more than   one implementation of dma-mapping calls and change/select them on the   struct device basis.  The first client of this new infractructure is   dmabounce implementation which has been completely cut out of the   core, common code.    The last patch of this redesign update introduces a new, experimental   implementation of dma-mapping calls on top of generic IOMMU framework.   This lets ARM sub-platform to transparently use IOMMU for DMA-mapping   calls if one provides required IOMMU hardware.

To add support to APEI GHES PCIe AER recovery, aer_recover_queue is added to export the recovery function in native PCIe AER driver.  Recoverable PCIe AER errors are reported via NMI in APEI GHES.  Then APEI GHES uses irq_work to delay the error processing into an IRQ handler.  But PCIe AER recovery can be very time-consuming, so aer_recover_queue, which can be used in IRQ handler, delays the real recovery action into the process context, that is, work queue.

This was to skip over the ftrace internal events (as they are not TRACE_EVENTs). But as the ftrace function event now has a ->reg() function attached to it for use with perf, it is no longer ignored.  Worse yet, this ->reg() function is being called when it should not be. It returns an error and causes the above warning to be printed.  By adding a new event_call flag (TRACE_EVENT_FL_IGNORE_ENABLE) and have all ftrace internel event structures have it set, setting the events/enable will no longe try to incorrectly enable the function event and does not warn.

The worst culprit was probably device.h since it is used everywhere. This file also had an implicit dependency/usage of mutex.h which was masked by module.h, and is also fixed here at the same time.  There are over a dozen other headers that simply declare the struct instead of pulling in the whole file, so follow their lead and simply make it a few more.  Most of the implicit dependencies on module.h being present by these headers pulling it in have been now weeded out, so we can finally make this change with hopefully minimal breakage.

This makes certain applications, like backup software, run much more quickly on buffered tape drives.  Since legacy applications do not know about this new MTWEOFI ioctl, this patch adds a new ioctl option that tells the st driver to return immediately when writing an EOF (i.e. a filemark). This new flag is much like the existing flag that tells the st driver to perform writes (and certain other IOs) immediately, but this new flag only applies to writing EOFs.  This new feature is controlled via the MTSETDRVBUFFER ioctl, using the newly-defined MT_ST_NOWAIT_EOF flag.  Use of this new feature is displayed via the sysfs tape "options" attribute.  The st documentation was updated to mention this new flag, as well as the problems that can occur from using it.

Highlights:    - Config guards make it impossible to enable the user namespace and      code that has not been converted to be user namespace safe.     - Use of the new kuid_t type ensures the if you somehow get past the      config guards the kernel will encounter type errors if you enable      user namespaces and attempt to compile in code whose permission      checks have not been updated to be user namespace safe.     - All uids from child user namespaces are mapped into the initial      user namespace before they are processed.  Removing the need to add      an additional check to see if the user namespace of the compared      uids remains the same.     - With the user namespaces compiled out the performance is as good or      better than it is today.     - For most operations absolutely nothing changes performance or      operationally with the user namespace enabled.     - The worst case performance I could come up with was timing 1      billion cache cold stat operations with the user namespace code      enabled.  This went from 156s to 164s on my laptop (or 156ns to      164ns per stat operation).     - (uid_t)-1 and (gid_t)-1 are reserved as an internal error value.      Most uid/gid setting system calls treat these value specially      anyway so attempting to use -1 as a uid would likely cause      entertaining failures in userspace.     - If setuid is called with a uid that can not be mapped setuid fails.      I have looked at sendmail, login, ssh and every other program I      could think of that would call setuid and they all check for and      handle the case where setuid fails.     - If stat or a similar system call is called from a context in which      we can not map a uid we lie and return overflowuid.  The LFS      experience suggests not lying and returning an error code might be      better, but the historical precedent with uids is different and I      can not think of anything that would break by lying about a uid we      can't map.     - Capabilities are localized to the current user namespace making it      safe to give the initial user in a user namespace all capabilities.

f | neighbour.h | s | 4.0K | 140 | John Fastabend | john.r.fastabend@intel.com | 1334509564 |  | net: add generic PF_BRIDGE:RTM_ FDB hooks  This adds two new flags NTF_MASTER and NTF_SELF that can now be used to specify where PF_BRIDGE netlink commands should be sent. NTF_MASTER sends the commands to the 'dev->master' device for parsing. Typically this will be the linux net/bridge, or open-vswitch devices. Also without any flags set the command will be handled by the master device as well so that current user space tools continue to work as expected.  The NTF_SELF flag will push the PF_BRIDGE commands to the device. In the basic example below the commands are then parsed and programmed in the embedded bridge.  Note if both NTF_SELF and NTF_MASTER bits are set then the command will be sent to both 'dev->master' and 'dev' this allows user space to easily keep the embedded bridge and software bridge in sync.  There is a slight complication in the case with both flags set when an error occurs. To resolve this the rtnl handler clears the NTF_ flag in the netlink ack to indicate which sets completed successfully. The add/del handlers will abort as soon as any error occurs.  To support this new net device ops were added to call into the device and the existing bridging code was refactored to use these. There should be no required changes in user space to support the current bridge behavior.  A basic setup with a SR-IOV enabled NIC looks like this,            veth0  veth2             ||      ||           ------------           ||  bridge0 ||   <---- software bridging           ------------                /                /   ethx.y      ethx     VF         PF      \         \          <---- propagate FDB entries to HW      \         \   --------------------   ||  Embedded Bridge ||    <---- hardware offloaded switching   --------------------  In this case the embedded bridge must be managed to allow 'veth0' to communicate with 'ethx.y' correctly. At present drivers managing the embedded bridge either send frames onto the network which then get dropped by the switch OR the embedded bridge will flood these frames. With this patch we have a mechanism to manage the embedded bridge correctly from user space. This example is specific to SR-IOV but replacing the VF with another PF or dropping this into the DSA framework generates similar management issues.  Examples session using the 'br'[1] tool to add, dump and then delete a mac address with a new "embedded" option and enabled ixgbe driver:  # br fdb add 22:35:19:ac:60:59 dev eth3 # br fdb port    mac addr                flags veth0   22:35:19:ac:60:58       static veth0   9a:5f:81:f7:f6:ec       local eth3    00:1b:21:55:23:59       local eth3    22:35:19:ac:60:59       static veth0   22:35:19:ac:60:57       static #br fdb add 22:35:19:ac:60:59 embedded dev eth3 #br fdb port    mac addr                flags veth0   22:35:19:ac:60:58       static veth0   9a:5f:81:f7:f6:ec       local eth3    00:1b:21:55:23:59       local eth3    22:35:19:ac:60:59       static veth0   22:35:19:ac:60:57       static eth3    22:35:19:ac:60:59       local embedded #br fdb del 22:35:19:ac:60:59 embedded dev eth3  I added a couple lines to 'br' to set the flags correctly is all.

f | dm-log-userspace.h | s | 14K | 389 | Jonathan E Brassow | jbrassow@redhat.com | 1320092484 |  | dm log userspace: add log device dependency  Allow userspace dm log implementations to register their log device so it is no longer missing from the list of device dependencies.  When device mapper targets use a device they normally call dm_get_device which includes it in the device list returned to userspace applications such as LVM through the DM_TABLE_DEPS ioctl.  Userspace log devices don't use dm_get_device as userspace opens them so they are missing from the list of dependencies.  This patch extends the DM_ULOG_CTR operation to allow userspace to respond with the name of the log device (if appropriate) to be registered via 'dm_get_device'.  DM_ULOG_REQUEST_VERSION is incremented.  This is backwards compatible.  If the kernel and userspace log server have both been updated, the new information will be passed down to the kernel and the device will be registered.  If the kernel is new, but the log server is old, the log server will not pass down any device information and the kernel will simply bypass the device registration as before.  If the kernel is old but the log server is new, the log server will see the old version number and not pass the device info.

The only way to register such operations is to define a sysdev class and a sysdev specifically for this purpose which is cumbersome and inefficient.  Moreover, the arguments taken by sysdev suspend, resume and shutdown callbacks are practically never necessary.  For this reason, introduce a simpler interface allowing subsystems to register operations to be executed very late during system suspend and shutdown and very early during resume in the form of strcut syscore_ops objects.

In this layout, every register actually has four u32:   1.) to store a value directly  2.) a SET register where every 1-bit sets the corresponding bit,      others are unaffected  3.) same with a CLR register  4.) same with a TOG (toggle) register  Also, the 2 MSBs in register 0 are always the same and can be used to reset the IP core.  All this is strictly speaking not mach-specific (but IP core specific) and, thus, doesn't need to be in mach-mxs/include. At least mx6 also uses IP cores following this stmp-style. So:  Introduce a stmp-style device, put the code and defines for that in a public place (lib/), and let drivers for stmp-style devices select that code. To avoid regressions and ease reviewing, the actual code is simply copied from mach-mxs. It definately wants updates, but those need a seperate patch series.  Voila, mach dependency gone, reusable code introduced. Note that I didn't remove the duplicated code from mach-mxs yet, first the drivers have to be converted.

This is a followup without any arch specific code.  Other than   that there are no functional changes.]  Some workloads that create a large number of small files tend to assign too many pages to node 0 (multi-node systems).  Part of the reason is that the rotor (in cpuset_mem_spread_node()) used to assign nodes starts at node 0 for newly created tasks.

However the kernel is trying to maximise memory usage, hence there are usually few free pages in the system and buggy code usually corrupts some crucial data.  This patch changes the buddy allocator to keep more free/protected pages and to interlace free/protected and allocated pages to increase the probability of catching corruption.  When the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, debug_guardpage_minorder defines the minimum order used by the page allocator to grant a request.  The requested size will be returned with the remaining pages used as guard pages.  The default value of debug_guardpage_minorder is zero: no change from current behaviour.

The state machine is preemptible, light-weight, and single-threaded, minimizing synchronization overhead.  In particular, there is no longer any need for synchronize_srcu() to be guarded by a mutex.  Expedited processing is handled, at least in the absence of concurrent grace-period operations on that same srcu_struct structure, by having the synchronize_srcu_expedited() thread take on the role of the workqueue thread for one iteration.  There is a reasonable probability that a given SRCU callback will be invoked on the same CPU that registered it, however, there is no guarantee.  Concurrent SRCU grace-period primitives can cause callbacks to be executed elsewhere, even in absence of CPU-hotplug operations.  Callbacks execute in process context, but under the influence of local_bh_disable(), so it is illegal to sleep in an SRCU callback function.

We also have to extend the per-device resources somewhat, as some devices now conveniently split control and data blocks.  So we allow a platform to register its set of SuperHyway devices via superhyway_add_devices() with the control block always ordered as the first resource (as this is the one that userspace cares about).

If this assertion fails, we get a nice error message at build time.  The GCC function attribute error("message") was added in version 4.3, so we define a new macro __linktime_error(message) to expand to this for GCC-4.3 and later.  This will give us an error diagnostic from the compiler on the line that fails.  For other compilers __linktime_error(message) expands to nothing, and we have to be content with a link time error, but at least we will still get a build error.  BUILD_BUG() expands to the undefined function __build_bug_failed() and will fail at link time if the compiler ever emits code for it.  On GCC-4.3 and later, attribute((error())) is used so that the failure will be noted at compile time instead.

f | personality.h | s | 3.5K | 105 | Andi Kleen | ak@linux.intel.com | 1314292648 |  | Add a personality to report 2.6.x version numbers  I ran into a couple of programs which broke with the new Linux 3.0 version.  Some of those were binary only.  I tried to use LD_PRELOAD to work around it, but it was quite difficult and in one case impossible because of a mix of 32bit and 64bit executables.  For example, all kind of management software from HP doesnt work, unless we pretend to run a 2.6 kernel.    $ uname -a   Linux svivoipvnx001 3.0.0-08107-g97cd98f #1062 SMP Fri Aug 12 18:11:45 CEST 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux    $ hpacucli ctrl all show    Error: No controllers detected.    $ rpm -qf /usr/sbin/hpacucli   hpacucli-8.75-12.0  Another notable case is that Python now reports "linux3" from sys.platform(); which in turn can break things that were checking sys.platform() == "linux2":    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664564  It seems pretty clear to me though it's a bug in the apps that are using '==' instead of .startswith(), but this allows us to unbreak broken programs.  This patch adds a UNAME26 personality that makes the kernel report a 2.6.40+x version number instead.  The x is the x in 3.x.  I know this is somewhat ugly, but I didn't find a better workaround, and compatibility to existing programs is important.  Some programs also read /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease.  This can be worked around in user space with mount --bind (and a mount namespace)  To use:    wget ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/ak/uname26/uname26.c   gcc -o uname26 uname26.c   ./uname26 program  Signed-off-by: Andi Kleen <ak@linux.intel.com> Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

This commit fixes a number of problems, making nodir much more usable.  - Major change to recovery: recover all locks and restart   all in-progress operations after recovery.  In some   cases it's not possible to know which in-progess locks   to recover, so recover all.  (Most require recovery   in nodir mode anyway since rehashing changes most   master nodes.)  - Change the way nodir mode is enabled, from a command   line mount arg passed through gfs2, into a sysfs   file managed by dlm_controld, consistent with the   other config settings.  - Allow recovering MSTCPY locks on an rsb that has not   yet been turned into a master copy.  - Ignore RCOM_LOCK and RCOM_LOCK_REPLY recovery messages   from a previous, aborted recovery cycle.  Base this   on the local recovery status not being in the state   where any nodes should be sending LOCK messages for the   current recovery cycle.  - Hold rsb lock around dlm_purge_mstcpy_locks() because it   may run concurrently with dlm_recover_master_copy().  - Maintain highbast on process-copy lkb's (in addition to   the master as is usual), because the lkb can switch   back and forth between being a master and being a   process copy as the master node changes in recovery.  - When recovering MSTCPY locks, flag rsb's that have   non-empty convert or waiting queues for granting   at the end of recovery.  (Rename flag from LOCKS_PURGED   to RECOVER_GRANT and similar for the recovery function,   because it's not only resources with purged locks   that need grant a grant attempt.)  - Replace a couple of unnecessary assertion panics with   error messages.

A device driver can allocate arbirary size of devres data which is associated with a release function.  On driver detach, release function is invoked on the devres data, then, devres data is freed.  devreses are typed by associated release functions.  Some devreses are better represented by single instance of the type while others need multiple instances sharing the same release function.  Both usages are supported.  devreses can be grouped using devres group such that a device driver can easily release acquired resources halfway through initialization or selectively release resources (e.g. resources for port 1 out of 4 ports).  This patch adds devres core including documentation and the following managed interfaces.  * alloc/free	: devm_kzalloc(), devm_kzfree() * IO region	: devm_request_region(), devm_release_region() * IRQ		: devm_request_irq(), devm_free_irq() * DMA		: dmam_alloc_coherent(), dmam_free_coherent(), 		  dmam_declare_coherent_memory(), dmam_pool_create(), 		  dmam_pool_destroy() * PCI		: pcim_enable_device(), pcim_pin_device(), pci_is_managed() * iomap		: devm_ioport_map(), devm_ioport_unmap(), devm_ioremap(), 		  devm_ioremap_nocache(), devm_iounmap(), pcim_iomap_table(), 		  pcim_iomap(), pcim_iounmap()  Signed-off-by: Tejun Heo <htejun@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Jeff Garzik <jeff@garzik.org>

f | poll.h | s | 4.5K | 139 | Hans Verkuil | hans.verkuil@cisco.com | 1332547118 |  | poll: add poll_requested_events() and poll_does_not_wait() functions  In some cases the poll() implementation in a driver has to do different things depending on the events the caller wants to poll for.  An example is when a driver needs to start a DMA engine if the caller polls for POLLIN, but doesn't want to do that if POLLIN is not requested but instead only POLLOUT or POLLPRI is requested.  This is something that can happen in the video4linux subsystem among others.  Unfortunately, the current epoll/poll/select implementation doesn't provide that information reliably.  The poll_table_struct does have it: it has a key field with the event mask.  But once a poll() call matches one or more bits of that mask any following poll() calls are passed a NULL poll_table pointer.  Also, the eventpoll implementation always left the key field at ~0 instead of using the requested events mask.  This was changed in eventpoll.c so the key field now contains the actual events that should be polled for as set by the caller.  The solution to the NULL poll_table pointer is to set the qproc field to NULL in poll_table once poll() matches the events, not the poll_table pointer itself.  That way drivers can obtain the mask through a new poll_requested_events inline.  The poll_table_struct can still be NULL since some kernel code calls it internally (netfs_state_poll() in ./drivers/staging/pohmelfs/netfs.h).  In that case poll_requested_events() returns ~0 (i.e.  all events).  Very rarely drivers might want to know whether poll_wait will actually wait.  If another earlier file descriptor in the set already matched the events the caller wanted to wait for, then the kernel will return from the select() call without waiting.  This might be useful information in order to avoid doing expensive work.  A new helper function poll_does_not_wait() is added that drivers can use to detect this situation.  This is now used in sock_poll_wait() in include/net/sock.h.  This was the only place in the kernel that needed this information.  Drivers should no longer access any of the poll_table internals, but use the poll_requested_events() and poll_does_not_wait() access functions instead.  In order to enforce that the poll_table fields are now prepended with an underscore and a comment was added warning against using them directly.  This required a change in unix_dgram_poll() in unix/af_unix.c which used the key field to get the requested events.  It's been replaced by a call to poll_requested_events().  For qproc it was especially important to change its name since the behavior of that field changes with this patch since this function pointer can now be NULL when that wasn't possible in the past.  Any driver accessing the qproc or key fields directly will now fail to compile.  Some notes regarding the correctness of this patch: the driver's poll() function is called with a 'struct poll_table_struct *wait' argument.  This pointer may or may not be NULL, drivers can never rely on it being one or the other as that depends on whether or not an earlier file descriptor in the select()'s fdset matched the requested events.  There are only three things a driver can do with the wait argument:  1) obtain the key field:  	events = wait ? wait->key : ~0;     This will still work although it should be replaced with the new    poll_requested_events() function (which does exactly the same).    This will now even work better, since wait is no longer set to NULL    unnecessarily.  2) use the qproc callback. This could be deadly since qproc can now be    NULL. Renaming qproc should prevent this from happening. There are no    kernel drivers that actually access this callback directly, BTW.  3) test whether wait == NULL to determine whether poll would return without    waiting. This is no longer sufficient as the correct test is now    wait == NULL |||| wait->_qproc == NULL.     However, the worst that can happen here is a slight performance hit in    the case where wait != NULL and wait->_qproc == NULL. In that case the    driver will assume that poll_wait() will actually add the fd to the set    of waiting file descriptors. Of course, poll_wait() will not do that    since it tests for wait->_qproc. This will not break anything, though.     There is only one place in the whole kernel where this happens    (sock_poll_wait() in include/net/sock.h) and that code will be replaced    by a call to poll_does_not_wait() in the next patch.     Note that even if wait->_qproc != NULL drivers cannot rely on poll_wait()    actually waiting. The next file descriptor from the set might match the    event mask and thus any possible waits will never happen.

Some filesystems depend on flusher thread progressing (e.g. because they need to flush delay allocated blocks to reduce allocation uncertainty) and so flusher thread doing truncate creates interesting dependencies and possibilities for deadlocks.  We get rid of iput() in flusher thread by using the fact that I_SYNC inode flag effectively pins the inode in memory. So if we take care to either hold i_lock or have I_SYNC set, we can get away without taking inode reference in writeback_sb_inodes().  As a side effect of these changes, we also fix possible use-after-free in wb_writeback() because inode_wait_for_writeback() call could try to reacquire i_lock on the inode that was already free.

We need to make sure the atomicy of read and ack in guest otherwise we may ack more times than being notified. This is done through handling the whole config change interrupt in an non-reentrant workqueue.  Signed-off-by: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com> Acked-by: Michael S.

Rather than add yet another include (<asm/unistd.h>) to make everything happy, just uninline the silly core dump helper functions and move the bodies to fs/exec.c where they make a lot more sense.  dump_seek() in particular was too big to be an inline function anyway, and none of them are in any way performance-critical.

The 2nd step can be solved by using appropriate CLONE_ flags and the unshare syscall, while there's currently no ways for solving the 1st one.  One of the ways for checking whether two tasks share e.g.  mm_struct is to provide some mm_struct ID of a task to its proc file, but showing such info considered to be not that good for security reasons.  Thus after some debates we end up in conclusion that using that named 'comparison' syscall might be the best candidate.  So here is it -- __NR_kcmp.  It takes up to 5 arguments - the pids of the two tasks (which characteristics should be compared), the comparison type and (in case of comparison of files) two file descriptors.  Lookups for pids are done in the caller's PID namespace only.  At moment only x86 is supported and tested.

f | seqlock.h | s | 7.4K | 248 | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1336169634 |  | seqlock: add 'raw_seqcount_begin()' function  The normal read_seqcount_begin() function will wait for any current writers to exit their critical region by looping until the sequence count is even.  That "wait for sequence count to stabilize" is the right thing to do if the read-locker will just retry the whole operation on contention: no point in doing a potentially expensive reader sequence if we know at the beginning that we'll just end up re-doing it all.  HOWEVER.  Some users don't actually retry the operation, but instead will abort and do the operation with proper locking.  So the sequence count case may be the optimistic quick case, but in the presense of writers you may want to do full locking in order to guarantee forward progress.  The prime example of this would be the RCU name lookup.  And in that case, you may well be better off without the "retry early", and are in a rush to instead get to the failure handling.  Thus this "raw" interface that just returns the sequence number without testing it - it just forces the low bit to zero so that read_seqcount_retry() will always fail such a "active concurrent writer" scenario.

f | taskstats_kern.h | s | 911B | 29 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

Probably because it originated from the same code, sharing history with the roundup version from before the bugfix (for that one, see commit 1a06a52ee1b0: "Fix roundup_pow_of_two(1)").  However, unlike the roundup version, the fix for rounddown is to just remove the broken special case entirely.  It's simply not needed - the generic code      1UL << ilog2(n)  does the right thing for the constant '1' argment too.  The only reason roundup needed that special case was because rounding up does so by subtracting one from the argument (and then adding one to the result) causing the obvious problems with "ilog2(0)".  But rounddown doesn't do any of that, since ilog2() naturally truncates (ie "rounds down") to the right rounded down value.  And without the ilog2(0) case, there's no reason for the special case that had the wrong value.  tl;dr: rounddown_pow_of_two(1) should be 1, not 0.

Using the discard mount option results in every freed block generating a discard request to the block device. This can be slow, since many block devices can only process discard requests of larger sizes, and also such operations can be time consuming.  Rather than using the discard mount option, FITRIM allows a sweep of the filesystem on an occasional basis, and also to optionally avoid sending down discard requests for smaller regions.  In GFS2 FITRIM will work at resource group granularity. There is a flag for each resource group which keeps track of which resource groups have been trimmed. This flag is reset whenever a deallocation occurs in the resource group, and set whenever a successful FITRIM of that resource group has taken place. This helps to reduce repeated discard requests for the same block ranges, again improving performance.  Signed-off-by: Steven Whitehouse <swhiteho@redhat.com>

Wysocki | rjw@sisk.pl | 1337366726 |  | PM / Domains: Make it possible to add devices to inactive domains  The generic PM domains core code currently requires domains to be in the "power on" state for adding devices to them, but this limitation turns out to be inconvenient in some situations, so remove it.  For this purpose, make __pm_genpd_add_device() set the device's need_restore flag if the domain is in the "power off" state, so that the device's "restore state" (usually .runtime_resume()) callback is executed when it is resumed after the domain has been turned on. If the domain is in the "power on" state, the device's need_restore flag will be cleared by __pm_genpd_add_device(), so that its "save state" (usually .runtime_suspend()) callback is executed when the domain is about to be turned off.  However, since that default behavior need not be always desirable, add a helper function pm_genpd_dev_need_restore() allowing a device's need_restore flag to be set/unset at any time.

This implements a random 16 byte string, available to every ELF program via a new auxv AT_RANDOM vector.  [1] http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2008-10/msg00006.html  Ulrich said:  glibc needs right after startup a bit of random data for internal protections (stack canary etc).  What is now in upstream glibc is that we always unconditionally open /dev/urandom, read some data, and use it.  For every process startup.  That's slow.  ...  The solution is to provide a limited amount of random data to the starting process in the aux vector.  I suggested 16 bytes and this is what the patch implements.  If we need only 16 bytes or less we use the data directly.  If we need more we'll use the 16 bytes to see a PRNG. This avoids the costly /dev/urandom use and it allows the kernel to use the most adequate source of random data for this purpose.  It might not be the same pool as that for /dev/urandom.  Concerns were expressed about the depletion of the randomness pool.  But this patch doesn't make the situation worse, it doesn't deplete entropy more than happens now.

f | delayacct.h | s | 4.0K | 134 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

We can use task_work instead and make this all private to kernel/irq/manage.c, cleanup plus micro-optimization.  1. rename exit_irq_thread() to irq_thread_dtor(), make it    static, and move it up before irq_thread().  2. change irq_thread() to do task_work_add(irq_thread_dtor)    at the start and task_work_cancel() before return.     tracehook_notify_resume() can never play with kthreads,    only do_exit()->exit_task_work() can call the callback    and this is what we want.  3. remove task_struct->irq_thread and the special hook    in do_exit().

This patch deals with most of it, and I can now at least use BR2684 and PPPoATM with 32-bit userspace.  I haven't added a .compat_ioctl method to struct atm_ioctl, because AFAICT none of the current users need any conversion -- so we can just call the ->ioctl() method in every case. I looked at br2684, clip, lec, mpc, pppoatm and atmtcp.  In svc_compat_ioctl() the only mangling which is needed is to change COMPAT_ATM_ADDPARTY to ATM_ADDPARTY. Although it's defined as 	_IOW('a', ATMIOC_SPECIAL+4,struct atm_iobuf) it doesn't actually _take_ a struct atm_iobuf as an argument -- it takes a struct sockaddr_atmsvc, which _is_ the same between 32-bit and 64-bit code, so doesn't need conversion.  Almost all of vcc_ioctl() would have been identical, so I converted that into a core do_vcc_ioctl() function with an 'int compat' argument.  I've done the same with atm_dev_ioctl(), where there _are_ a few differences, but still it's relatively contained and there would otherwise have been a lot of duplication.  I haven't done any of the actual device-specific ioctls, although I've added a compat_ioctl method to struct atmdev_ops.

The cache needs to be flushed if the cic's ioprio or blkcg has changed.  It is currently done by requiring the changing action to set the respective ICQ_*_CHANGED bit in the icq and testing it from cfq_set_request(), which involves iterating through all the affected icqs.  All cfq wants to know is whether ioprio and/or blkcg have changed since the last flush and can be easily achieved by just remembering the current ioprio and blkcg ID in cic.  This patch adds cic->{ioprio||blkcg_id}, updates all ioprio users to use the remembered value instead, and updates cfq_set_request() path such that, instead of using icq_get_changed(), the current values are compared against the remembered ones and trigger appropriate flush action if not.  Condition tests are moved inside both _changed functions which are now named check_ioprio_changed() and check_blkcg_changed().  ioprio.h::task_ioprio*() can't be used anymore and replaced with open-coded IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE case in cfq_async_queue_prio().

The code in the kernel is about seven years old and I noticed that the external zlib library's inflate performance was significantly faster (~50%) than the code in the kernel on ARM (and faster again on x86_32).  For comparison the newer deflate code is 20% slower on ARM and 50% slower on x86_32 but gives an approx 1% compression ratio improvement.  I don't consider this to be an improvement for kernel use so have no plans to change the zlib_deflate code.  Various changes have been made to the zlib code in the kernel, the most significant being the extra functions/flush option used by ppp_deflate. This update reimplements the features PPP needs to ensure it continues to work.  This code has been tested on ARM under both JFFS2 (with zlib compression enabled) and ppp_deflate and on x86_32.  JFFS2 sees an approx.  10% real world file read speed improvement.  This patch also removes ZLIB_VERSION as it no longer has a correct value. We don't need version checks anyway as the kernel's module handling will take care of that for us.

Fix is ugly, but allows to bisect the patch set. And it will be removed later in the series.  This patch makes RPC clients PipeFs dentries allocations in it's owner network namespace context. RPC client pipefs dentries creation logic has been changed: 1) Pipefs dentries creation by sb was moved to separated function, which will be used for handling PipeFS mount notification. 2) Initial value of RPC client PipeFS dir dentry is set no NULL now.  RPC client pipefs dentries cleanup logic has been changed: 1) Cleanup is done now in separated rpc_remove_pipedir() function, which takes care about pipefs superblock locking.  Also this patch removes slashes from cb_program.pipe_dir_name and from NFS_PIPE_DIRNAME to make rpc_d_lookup_sb() work. This doesn't affect vfs_path_lookup() results in nfs4blocklayout_init() since this slash is cutted off anyway in link_path_walk().

f | nfs_mount.h | s | 2.3K | 69 | Suresh Jayaraman | sjayaraman@suse.de | 1285246558 |  | nfs: introduce mount option '-olocal_lock' to make locks local  NFS clients since 2.6.12 support flock locks by emulating fcntl byte-range locks. Due to this, some windows applications which seem to use both flock (share mode lock mapped as flock by Samba) and fcntl locks sequentially on the same file, can't lock as they falsely assume the file is already locked. The problem was reported on a setup with windows clients accessing excel files on a Samba exported share which is originally a NFS mount from a NetApp filer.  Older NFS clients (< 2.6.12) did not see this problem as flock locks were considered local. To support legacy flock behavior, this patch adds a mount option "-olocal_lock=" which can take the following values:     'none'  		- Neither flock locks nor POSIX locks are local    'flock' 		- flock locks are local    'posix' 		- fcntl/POSIX locks are local    'all'		- Both flock locks and POSIX locks are local  Testing:     - This patch was tested by using -olocal_lock option with different values      and the NLM calls were noted from the network packet captured.       'none'  - NLM calls were seen during both flock() and fcntl(), flock lock    	       was granted, fcntl was denied      'flock' - no NLM calls for flock(), NLM call was seen for fcntl(),    	       granted      'posix' - NLM call was seen for flock() - granted, no NLM call for fcntl()      'all'   - no NLM calls were seen during both flock() and fcntl()     - No bugs were seen during NFSv4 locking/unlocking in general and NFSv4      reboot recovery.

Biederman | ebiederm@xmission.com | 1335430899 |  | userns: Rework the user_namespace adding uid/gid mapping support  - Convert the old uid mapping functions into compatibility wrappers - Add a uid/gid mapping layer from user space uid and gids to kernel   internal uids and gids that is extent based for simplicty and speed.   * Working with number space after mapping uids/gids into their kernel     internal version adds only mapping complexity over what we have today,     leaving the kernel code easy to understand and test. - Add proc files /proc/self/uid_map /proc/self/gid_map   These files display the mapping and allow a mapping to be added   if a mapping does not exist. - Allow entering the user namespace without a uid or gid mapping.   Since we are starting with an existing user our uids and gids   still have global mappings so are still valid and useful they just don't   have local mappings.  The requirement for things to work are global uid   and gid so it is odd but perfectly fine not to have a local uid   and gid mapping.   Not requiring global uid and gid mappings greatly simplifies   the logic of setting up the uid and gid mappings by allowing   the mappings to be set after the namespace is created which makes the   slight weirdness worth it. - Make the mappings in the initial user namespace to the global   uid/gid space explicit.  Today it is an identity mapping   but in the future we may want to twist this for debugging, similar   to what we do with jiffies. - Document the memory ordering requirements of setting the uid and   gid mappings.  We only allow the mappings to be set once   and there are no pointers involved so the requirments are   trivial but a little atypical.  Performance:  In this scheme for the permission checks the performance is expected to stay the same as the actuall machine instructions should remain the same.  The worst case I could think of is ls -l on a large directory where all of the stat results need to be translated with from kuids and kgids to uids and gids.  So I benchmarked that case on my laptop with a dual core hyperthread Intel i5-2520M cpu with 3M of cpu cache.  My benchmark consisted of going to single user mode where nothing else was running. On an ext4 filesystem opening 1,000,000 files and looping through all of the files 1000 times and calling fstat on the individuals files.  This was to ensure I was benchmarking stat times where the inodes were in the kernels cache, but the inode values were not in the processors cache.  My results:  v3.4-rc1:         ~= 156ns (unmodified v3.4-rc1 with user namespace support disabled) v3.4-rc1-userns-: ~= 155ns (v3.4-rc1 with my user namespace patches and user namespace support disabled) v3.4-rc1-userns+: ~= 164ns (v3.4-rc1 with my user namespace patches and user namespace support enabled)  All of the configurations ran in roughly 120ns when I performed tests that ran in the cpu cache.  So in summary the performance impact is: 1ns improvement in the worst case with user namespace support compiled out. 8ns aka 5% slowdown in the worst case with user namespace support compiled in.

The worst culprit was probably device.h since it is used everywhere. This file also had an implicit dependency/usage of mutex.h which was masked by module.h, and is also fixed here at the same time.  There are over a dozen other headers that simply declare the struct instead of pulling in the whole file, so follow their lead and simply make it a few more.

Thomas diagnosed this as the following pattern: CPU 0                                                    CPU 1 do_adjtimex()   spin_lock_irq(&ntp_lock);     process_adjtimex_modes();				 timer_interrupt()       process_adj_status();                                do_timer()         ntp_start_leap_timer();                             write_lock(&xtime_lock);           hrtimer_start();                                  update_wall_time();              hrtimer_reprogram();                            ntp_tick_length()                tick_program_event()                            spin_lock(&ntp_lock);                  clockevents_program_event() 		   ktime_get()                      seq = req_seqbegin(xtime_lock);  This patch tries to avoid the problem by reverting back to not using an hrtimer to inject leapseconds, and instead we handle the leapsecond processing in the second_overflow() function.  The downside to this change is that on systems that support highres timers, the leap second processing will occur on a HZ tick boundary, (ie: ~1-10ms, depending on HZ)  after the leap second instead of possibly sooner (~34us in my tests w/ x86_64 lapic).  This patch applies on top of tip/timers/core.

The recent data from Ingo[1] shows that this is one of several instances that has a significant impact on compile times, and it should be targeted for factoring out (as done here).  Note that several commonly used header files in include/* directly include <linux/module.h> themselves (some 34 of them!) The most commonly used ones of these will have to be made independent of module.h before the full benefit of this change can be realized.  We also transition THIS_MODULE from module.h to export.h, since there are lots of files with subsystem structs that in turn will have a struct module *owner and only be doing:  	.owner = THIS_MODULE;  and absolutely nothing else modular. So, we also want to have the THIS_MODULE definition present in the lightweight header.  [1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/23/76  Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>

Clean up the users as follows:  1) For those headers only needing "struct device" as a pointer in fcn args, replace the include with exactly that.  2) For headers not really using anything from device.h, simply delete the include altogether.  3) For headers relying on getting device.h implicitly before being included themselves, now explicitly include device.h  4) For files in which doing #1 or #2 uncovers an implicit dependency on some other header, fix by explicitly adding the required header(s).  Any C files that were implicitly relying on device.h to be present have already been dealt with in advance.  Total removals from #1 and #2: 51.  Total additions coming from #3: 9.  Total other implicit dependencies from #4: 7.

This makes it safe to use in NMI handlers and other special unblockable contexts that could otherwise deadlock on locks.  This is implemented by using atomic operations and retries on any conflicts. The disadvantage is that there may be livelocks in extreme cases.  For better scalability, one gen_pool allocator can be used for each CPU.  The lockless operation only works if there is enough memory available. If new memory is added to the pool a lock has to be still taken.  So any user relying on locklessness has to ensure that sufficient memory is preallocated.  The basic atomic operation of this allocator is cmpxchg on long.  On architectures that don't have NMI-safe cmpxchg implementation, the allocator can NOT be used in NMI handler.  So code uses the allocator in NMI handler should depend on CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_NMI_SAFE_CMPXCHG.

For example, pm_qos_update_request_timeout(req, 100, 1000), means that QoS request on req with value 100 will be active for 1000 microseconds. After 1000 microseconds, the QoS request thru req is reset. If there were another pm_qos_update_request(req, x) during the 1000 us, this new request with value x will override as this is another request on the same req handle. A new request on the same req handle will always override the previous request whether it is the conventional request or it is the new timeout request.

In an effort to remove OMAP_TAG_LCD, this patch adds omapfb_set_lcd_config() function that the board files can call to set the LCD config.  This has the drawback that configuration can no longer come from the bootloader. Of the boards supported by the kernel, this should only affect N770 which depends on the data from the bootloader. This patch adds an LCD config for N770 to its board files, but that is most probably broken. Fixing this would need information about the HW setup in N770 boards.

This is for modems that support data connections with raw IP frames instead of PPP. On high speed data connections this eliminates a significant amount of PPP overhead. To use this interface, the application must first tell the modem to open a network connection on a virtual tty. Once that has been accomplished, the app will issue an IOCTL on that virtual tty to create the network interface. The IOCTL will return the index of the interface created.

They were mostly limited   to 386-sx 16MHz CPU and some 486 class machines and never more than   64MB of RAM.  Even the enthusiast hobbyist community seems to have   dried up close to ten years ago, based on what you can find searching   various websites dedicated to the relatively short lived hardware.    So lets remove the support relating to CONFIG_MCA.  There is no point   carrying this forward, wasting cycles doing routine maintenance on it;   wasting allyesconfig build time on validating it, wasting I/O on git   grep'ping over it, and so on."  Let's see if anybody screams.  It generally has compiled, and James Bottomley pointed out that there was a MCA extension from NCR that allowed for up to 4GB of memory and PPro-class machines.  So in *theory* there may be users out there.  But even James (technically listed as a maintainer) doesn't actually have a system, and while Alan Cox claims to have a machine in his cellar that he offered to anybody who wants to take it off his hands, he didn't argue for keeping MCA support either.  So we could bring it back.  But somebody had better speak up and talk about how they have actually been using said MCA hardware with modern kernels for us to do that.  And David already took the patch to delete all the networking driver code (commit a5e371f61ad3: "drivers/net: delete all code/drivers depending on CONFIG_MCA").  * 'delete-mca' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulg/linux:   MCA: delete all remaining traces of microchannel bus support.   scsi: delete the MCA specific drivers and driver code   serial: delete the MCA specific 8250 support.   arm: remove ability to select CONFIG_MCA

OK, but afaics currently this can only help wait_task_zombie() which calls __task_cred() without rcu lock.  Remove this validation and change wait_task_zombie() to use task_uid() instead.  This means we do rcu_read_lock() only to shut up the lockdep, but we already do the same in, say, wait_task_stopped().  task_is_dead() should die, task->exit_state != 0 means that this task has passed exit_notify(), only do_wait-like code paths should use this.  Unfortunately, we can't kill task_is_dead() right now, it has already acquired buggy users in drivers/staging.  The fix already exists.

In hindsight, it would have been better to add the new info *before* the packet: as it is, users need a lot of tricky code to skip the extra 2 bytes in the middle of the iovec, and in fact applications seem to get it wrong, and only work with specific iovec layout.  The fact we might need to split iovec also means we might in theory overflow iovec max size.  This patch adds a simpler way for applications to handle this, and future proofs the interface against further extensions, by making the size of the virtio net header configurable from userspace. As a result, tun driver will simply skip the extra 2 bytes on both input and output.  Signed-off-by: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@redhat.com> Acked-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

For this particular patch, it will apply cleanly and has been tested all the way back to 2.6.36.  The kprobes code uses the text_poke() function which accommodates writing a breakpoint into a read-only page.  The x86 kgdb code can solve the problem similarly by overriding the default breakpoint set/remove routines and using text_poke() directly.  The x86 kgdb code will first attempt to use the traditional probe_kernel_write(), and next try using a the text_poke() function. The break point install method is tracked such that the correct break point removal routine will get called later on.

Users can't use the private fields of neither the iommu_domain nor the IOMMU device, because those are already used by the IOMMU core and low level driver (respectively).  This patch just simply allows users to pass a private token (most notably their own context pointer) to iommu_set_fault_handler(), and then makes sure it is provided back to the users whenever an IOMMU fault happens.

f | of_mdio.h | s | 837B | 22 | David Daney | david.daney@cavium.com | 1336445889 |  | netdev/of/phy: New function: of_mdio_find_bus().  Add of_mdio_find_bus() which allows an mii_bus to be located given its associated the device tree node.  This is needed by the follow-on patch to add a driver for MDIO bus multiplexers.  The of_mdiobus_register() function is modified so that the device tree node is recorded in the mii_bus.  Then we can find it again by iterating over all mdio_bus_class devices.  Because the OF device tree has now become an integral part of the kernel, this can live in mdio_bus.c (which contains the needed mdio_bus_class structure) instead of of_mdio.c.

f | ipv6.h | s | 11K | 462 | Jiri Benc | jbenc@redhat.com | 1329112001 |  | net: implement IP_RECVTOS for IP_PKTOPTIONS  Currently, it is not easily possible to get TOS/DSCP value of packets from an incoming TCP stream. The mechanism is there, IP_PKTOPTIONS getsockopt with IP_RECVTOS set, the same way as incoming TTL can be queried. This is not actually implemented for TOS, though.  This patch adds this functionality, both for IPv4 (IP_PKTOPTIONS) and IPv6 (IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS). For IPv4, like in the IP_RECVTTL case, the value of the TOS field is stored from the other party's ACK.  This is needed for proxies which require DSCP transparency. One such example is at http://zph.bratcheda.org/.  Signed-off-by: Jiri Benc <jbenc@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
