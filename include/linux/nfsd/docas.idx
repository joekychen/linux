f | stats.h | s | 1.6K | 41 | Greg Banks | gnb@sgi.com | 1238197716 |  | Fix a build warning about leaking CONFIG_NFSD to userspace.  Fix a build warning about leaking CONFIG_NFSD to userspace.  The nfsd_stats data structure does not need to be available to userspace; no kernel interface uses it.  So move it inside #ifdef __KERNEL__ and the warning goes away.

f | debug.h | s | 934B | 41 | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
f | cld.h | s | 1.8K | 49 | Jeff Layton | jlayton@redhat.com | 1332776987 |  | nfsd: add a header describing upcall to nfsdcld  The daemon takes a versioned binary struct. Hopefully this should allow us to revise the struct later if it becomes necessary.  Signed-off-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>

f | Kbuild | g | 99B |  | Jeff Layton | jlayton@redhat.com | 1334603952 |  | nfsd: include cld.h in the headers_install target  The cld.h file contains the definition of the upcall format to talk with nfsdcld. When I added the file though, I neglected to add it to the headers-y target, so make headers_install wasn't installing it.  Signed-off-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: J.
