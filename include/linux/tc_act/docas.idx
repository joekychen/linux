The following checksums are supported by this patch:  - IPv4: IPv4 header, ICMP, IGMP, TCP, UDP & UDPLite  - IPv6: ICMPv6, TCP, UDP & UDPLite It's possible to request in the same action to update different kind of checksums, if the packets flow mix TCP, UDP and UDPLite, ...  An example of usage is done in the associated iproute2 patch.  Version 3 changes:  - remove useless goto instructions  - improve IPv6 hop options decoding  Version 2 changes:  - coding style correction  - remove useless arguments of some functions  - use stack in tcf_csum_dump()  - add tcf_csum_skb_nextlayer() to factor code  Signed-off-by: Gregoire Baron <baronchon@n7mm.org> Acked-by: jamal <hadi@cyberus.ca> Signed-off-by: David S.
