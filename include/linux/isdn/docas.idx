I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
f | capilli.h | s | 3.4K | 91 | Jan Kiszka | jan.kiszka@web.de | 1266364882 |  | CAPI: Rework locking of controller data structures  This patch applies the mutex so far only protecting the controller list to (almost) all accesses of controller data structures. It also reworks waiting on state changes in old_capi_manufacturer so that it no longer poll and holds a module reference to the controller owner while waiting (the latter was partly done already). Modification and checking of the blocked state remains racy by design, the caller is responsible for dealing with this.  Signed-off-by: Jan Kiszka <jan.kiszka@web.de> Signed-off-by: David S.
