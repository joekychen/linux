f | hash.h | s | 526B | 12 | Yehuda Sadeh | yehuda@hq.newdream.net | 1287614248 |  | ceph: factor out libceph from Ceph file system  This factors out protocol and low-level storage parts of ceph into a separate libceph module living in net/ceph and include/linux/ceph.  This is mostly a matter of moving files around.  However, a few key pieces of the interface change as well:   - ceph_client becomes ceph_fs_client and ceph_client, where the latter    captures the mon and osd clients, and the fs_client gets the mds client    and file system specific pieces.  - Mount option parsing and debugfs setup is correspondingly broken into    two pieces.  - The mon client gets a generic handler callback for otherwise unknown    messages (mds map, in this case).  - The basic supported/required feature bits can be expanded (and are by    ceph_fs_client).  No functional change, aside from some subtle error handling cases that got cleaned up in the refactoring process.  Signed-off-by: Sage Weil <sage@newdream.net>
