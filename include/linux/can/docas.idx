f | Kbuild | g | 95B |  | Oliver Hartkopp | socketcan@hartkopp.net | 1316209071 |  | can-gw: add netlink based CAN routing  This patch adds a CAN Gateway/Router to route (and modify) CAN frames.  It is based on the PF_CAN core infrastructure for msg filtering and msg sending and can optionally modify routed CAN frames on the fly. CAN frames can *only* be routed between CAN network interfaces (one hop). They can be modified with AND/OR/XOR/SET operations as configured by the netlink configuration interface known e.g. from iptables. From the netlink view this can-gw implements RTM_{NEW||DEL||GET}ROUTE for PF_CAN.  The CAN specific userspace tool to manage CAN routing entries can be found in the CAN utils http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/socketcan/trunk/can-utils/cangw.c at the SocketCAN SVN on BerliOS.
