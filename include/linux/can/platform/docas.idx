When an interrupt occurs, the INT pin is driven low by the MCP251x controller (falling edge) but in some cases the INT pin can be connected to the MPU through a transistor or level translator which inverts this signal. In this case interrupt should be configured in rising edge.  This patch adds support to pass the IRQ flags via mcp251x_platform_data.

CAN module on AM3517 requires programming of IO expander as part of init sequence - to enable CAN PHY. Added platform specific callback to handle phy control(switch on /off).

Support for Coldfire is missing though at the moment as they have an older revision of the core which does not have RX FIFO support.

f | sja1000.h | s | 1.0K | 30 | Wolfgang Grandegger | wg@grandegger.com | 1274161188 |  | can: sja1000 platform data fixes  The member "clock" of struct "sja1000_platform_data" is documented as "CAN bus oscillator frequency in Hz" but it's actually used as the CAN clock frequency, which is half of it. To avoid further confusion, this patch fixes it by renaming the member to "osc_freq". That way, also non mainline users will notice the change. The platform code for the relevant boards is updated accordingly. Furthermore, pre-defined values are now used for the members "ocr" and "cdr".
