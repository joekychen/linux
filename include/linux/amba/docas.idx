We remove it and use a generic approach instead. A new ios_handler is added, the purpose of which e.g. can be to control GPIO pins to a levelshifter.  Previously the vdd_handler was also used for making additional changes to the power register bits. This option is superfluous and is therefore removed.  Adaptaptions from the old vdd_handler to the new ios_handler is done for mach-ux500 board, which was the only one using the vdd_handler.  This patch is based upon a patch from Sebastian Rasmussen.

This is modeled after the static definition macros recently introduced into <linux/amba/bus.h> and can help us in factoring out a bunch of code across the kernel. Since a lot of call sites seem to be using a returned struct amba device* pointer, let's use that.
