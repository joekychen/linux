We could include <linux/export.h>, but it is better to avoid chaining.  Fortunately someone else already thought of this, and made a similar inline into a #define in <linux/device.h> for device_schedule_callback(), [see commit 523ded71de0] so follow that precedent here.  Also bubble up any __must_check that were used on the prev. wrapper inline functions up one to the real __register functions, to preserve any prev. sanity checks that were used in those instances.

Take appropriate action when reservation conflicts are detected.   - Correctly identify which reservation wins the conflict.   - Protect alien BP reservations.   - If an owned reservation loses, resize/move it.   - Follow the backoff procedure before requesting additional MAS.  When reservations are terminated, move the remaining reservations (if necessary) so they keep following the MAS allocation rules.
