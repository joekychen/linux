f | little_endian.h | s | 3.7K | 102 | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1274887815 |  | Revert "endian: #define __BYTE_ORDER"  This reverts commit b3b77c8caef1750ebeea1054e39e358550ea9f55, which was also totally broken (see commit 0d2daf5cc858 that reverted the crc32 version of it).  As reported by Stephen Rothwell, it causes problems on big-endian machines:  > In file included from fs/jfs/jfs_types.h:33, >                  from fs/jfs/jfs_incore.h:26, >                  from fs/jfs/file.c:22: > fs/jfs/endian24.h:36:101: warning: "__LITTLE_ENDIAN" is not defined  The kernel has never had that crazy "__BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN" model.  It's not how we do things, and it isn't how we _should_ do things.  So don't go there.

This involves:  * Removing the __KERNEL__ tests from generic.h and dropping it from   Kbuild. * Wrapping the inclusions of generic.h in both big_endian.h and   little_endian.h in __KERNEL__ tests. * Shifting big_endian.h and little_endian.h from header-y to   unifdef-y in Kbuild.
