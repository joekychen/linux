This driver is designed to be reusable between multiple SoCs that share the same basic building block, but so far it has only been used on Emma Mobile EV2.  Each driver instance handles 32 GPIOs with individually maskable IRQs. The driver operates on two I/O memory ranges and the 32 GPIOs are hooked up to two interrupts.  In the case of Emma Mobile EV2 this GPIO building block is used as main external interrupt controller hooking up 159 GPIOS as 159 interrupts via 5 driver instances and 10 interrupts to the GIC and the Cortex-A9 Dual.
