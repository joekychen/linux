Use the reset button to power    the board back up; the power supply LED will be on, but the    MSP430 waits to re-activate the regulators.   - On probe() this:      * Announces firmware revision      * Turns off the banked LEDs      * Exports the resources noted above      * Hooks the power-off support      * Muxes tvp5146 -or- imager for video input  Unless the new tvp514x driver (tracked for mainline) is configured, this assumes that some custom imager driver handles video-in.  This completely ignores the registers reporting the output voltages on the various power supplies.  Someone could add a hwmon interface if that seems useful.

To work correctly, it should be two byte writes,   not a single word write.  As it stands, it does nothing.  - Some devices with sx150x expanders installed have their NRESET pins   ganged on the same line, so resetting one causes the others to reset -   not a nice thing to do arbitrarily!  - The probe, usually taking place at boot, implies a recent hard-reset,   so a software reset at this point is just a waste of energy anyway.  Therefore, make it optional, defaulting to off, as this will match the common case of probing at powerup and also matches the current broken no-op behavior.
