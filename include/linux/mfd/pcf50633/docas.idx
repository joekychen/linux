f | mbc.h | s | 4.0K | 118 | Paul Fertser | fercerpav@gmail.com | 1258331529 |  | pcf50633: Query charger status directly  Current scheme is fragile and is likely to go off sync, especially on batfull->adapter charging automatic MBC transition.  Query the status bit every time we need it instead.  We need to export another function to query for USB presence because we can't read anything from PCF50633 (via I2C) inside irq context and that is needed by usb gadgets.
