This patch enables platform or board specific hooks to put the device into power down mode in case not needed.  This patch is a preparation for enabling this powering routine in n900 (rx-51) devices.  Thanks to Heikki Krogerus for helping out with the patch.

It has few HW bug fixes with minor changes in register set.  max17050 is same as max17047 chip except its silicon packging. So from driver's point of view there is no difference btw max1047 and max1050.  This patch adds the support to dynamically detect the chip type and adds steps to initialize the max17047 chip.

The bq27000 is similar to the bq27200 except that it uses the HDQ bus instead of I2C to communicate with the host system.  The driver is implemented as a platform driver. The driver expects to be provided with a read callback function through its platform data. The read function is assumed to do the lowlevel HDQ handling and read out the value of a certain register.
