f | dmx.h | s | 3.9K | 131 | Andreas Oberritter | obi@linuxtv.org | 1252768663 |  | V4L/DVB (12275): Add two new ioctls: DMX_ADD_PID and DMX_REMOVE_PID  DMX_ADD_PID allows to add multiple PIDs to a transport stream filter previously set up with DMX_SET_PES_FILTER and output=DMX_OUT_TSDEMUX_TAP.  DMX_REMOVE_PID is used to drop a PID from a filter.  These ioctls are to be used by readers of /dev/dvb/adapterX/demuxY. They may be called at any time, i.e. before or after the first filter on the shared file descriptor was started.  They make it possible to record multiple services without the need to de- or re-multiplex TS packets.  To accomplish this, dmxdev_filter->feed.ts has been converted to a list of struct dmxdev_feeds, each containing a PID value and a pointer to a struct dmx_ts_feed.

So, I'll wait until the next merge window before removing those unused ioctls, to give a chance for developers to submit their pending work.  This reverts commit db48923da6c528d461b5e764692239eb9c1b7a00.
