f | omap-panel-nokia-dsi.h | s | 763B | 24 | Tomi Valkeinen | tomi.valkeinen@ti.com | 1336549985 |  | OMAPDSS: DSI: implement generic DSI pin config  In preparation for device tree, this patch changes how the DSI pins are configured. The current configuration method is only doable with board files and the configuration data is OMAP specific.  This patch moves the configuration data to the panel's platform data, and the data can easily be given via DT in the future. The configuration data format is also changed to a generic one which should be suitable for all platforms.  The new format is an array of pin numbers, where the array items start from clock + and -, then data1 + and -, and so on. For example:  { 	0,	// pin num for clock lane + 	1,	// pin num for clock lane - 	2,	// pin num for data1 lane + 	3,	// pin num for data1 lane - 	... }  The pin numbers are translated by the DSI driver and used to configure the hardware appropriately.

f | omapdss.h | s | 20K | 624 | Chandrabhanu Mahapatra | cmahapatra@ti.com | 1337673555 |  | OMAPDSS: DISPC: Support rotation through TILER  TILER is a block in OMAP4's DMM which lets DSS fetch frames in a rotated manner. Physical memory can be mapped to a portion of OMAP's system address space called TILER address space. The TILER address space is split into 8 views. Each view represents a rotated or mirrored form of the mapped physical memory. When a DISPC overlay's base address is programmed to one of these views, the TILER fetches the pixels according to the orientation of the view. A view is further split into 4 containers, each container holds elements of a particular size. Rotation can be achieved at the granularity of elements in the container. For more information on TILER, refer to the Memory Subsytem section in OMAP4 TRM. Rotation type TILER has been added which is used to exploit the capabilities of these 8 views for performing various rotations.  When fetching from addresses mapped to TILER space, the DISPC DMA can fetch pixels in either 1D or 2D bursts. The fetch depends on which TILER container we are accessing. Accessing 8, 16 and 32 bit sized containers requires 2D bursts, and page mode sized containers require 1D bursts.  The DSS2 user is expected to provide the Tiler address of the view that it is interested in. This is passed to the paddr and p_uv_addr parameters in omap_overlay_info. It is also expected to provide the stride value based on the view's orientation and container type, this should be passed to the screen_width parameter of omap_overlay_info. In calc_tiler_rotation_offset screen_width is used to calculate the required row_inc for DISPC. x_predecim and y_predecim are also used to calculate row_inc and pix_inc thereby adding predecimation support for TILER.

It uses the firmware class to retrieve the waveform, and the request to initiate the waveform storing is done via a driver sysfs entry, loadstore_waveform.  Broadsheet is a framebuffer device.  It is slightly different from a typical framebuffer controller that drives a normal TFT-LCD display.  Most E-Ink display panels require a waveform in order to function.  That is, in order to drive the state of a pixel to black, gray, or white, a specific waveform is utilized.  Basically, that waveform represents the specific E-field wiggling needed to get the pixel to its optimal state given current temperature, and its previous state.  TN/IPS-LCDs use a similar concept but the driving waveform is sufficiently simple that it is internalized in the TFT source/gate driver.  These E-Ink waveforms are specific to a production batch.  That is, a batch of display films are produced, then they get characterized and a waveform is generated for that batch.  Broadsheet, typically, is attached to its private SPI flash which is then flashed with this waveform.  Users won't be able to see the waveform and typically won't ever need to know about it.  If however, the display panel attached to broadsheet is changed out, then they will need to update their waveform.  That would typically be done at a factory or repair facility rather than by a user.
