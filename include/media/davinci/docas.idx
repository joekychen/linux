The ccdc hw modules register with the driver and are used for configuring the CCD Controller for a specific decoder interface. The driver also registers the sub devices required for a specific evm. More than one sub devices can be registered. This allows driver to switch dynamically to capture video from any sub device that is registered. Currently only one sub device (tvp5146) is supported. But in future this driver is expected to do capture from sensor devices such as Micron's MT9T001, MT9T031 and MT9P031 etc. The driver currently supports MMAP based IO.
