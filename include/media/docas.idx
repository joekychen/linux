The worst culprit was probably device.h since it is used everywhere. This file also had an implicit dependency/usage of mutex.h which was masked by module.h, and is also fixed here at the same time.  There are over a dozen other headers that simply declare the struct instead of pulling in the whole file, so follow their lead and simply make it a few more.

Both videobuf-dma versions are supported, contig and sg, selectable with a module option. The former uses less processing power, but often fails to allocate contignuous buffer memory. The latter is free of this problem, but generates tens of DMA interrupts per frame. If contig memory allocation ever fails, the driver falls back to sg automatically on next open, but still can be switched back to contig manually. Both paths work stable for me, even under heavy load, on my OMAP1510 based Amstrad Delta videophone, that is the oldest, least powerfull OMAP1 implementation.  The interface generally works in pass-through mode. Since input data byte endianess can be swapped, it provides up to two v4l2 pixel formats per each of several soc_mbus formats that have their swapped endian counterparts.  Boards using this driver can provide it with the following platform data: - if and what freqency clock is expected by an on-board camera sensor, - what is the maximum pixel clock that should be accepted from the sensor, - what is the polarity of the sensor provided pixel clock, - if the interface GPIO line is connected to a sensor reset/powerdown input   and what is the input polarity.

However, commit c53c2549333b340e2662dc64ec81323476b69a97 that added the new v4l2_subscribed_event_ops introduced a regression: while the code still queued that initial event the __v4l2_event_queue_fh() function was modified to ignore such requests if sev->elems was 0 (meaning that the event subscription wasn't finished yet).  And sev->elems was only set to a non-zero value after the add operation returned.  This patch fixes this by passing the elems value to the add function. Then the add function can set it before queuing the initial event.

It was possible to add more events afterwards, but there was no way to ensure that you wouldn't miss important events if the event queue would fill up for that filehandle.  In addition, once there were no more free events, any new events were simply dropped on the floor.  For the control event in particular this made life very difficult since control status/value changes could just be missed if the number of allocated events and the speed at which the application read events was too low to keep up with the number of generated events. The application would have no idea what the latest state was for a control since it could have missed the latest control change.  So this patch makes some major changes in how events are allocated. Instead of allocating events per-filehandle they are now allocated when subscribing an event. So for that particular event type N events (determined by the driver) are allocated. Those events are reserved for that particular event type. This ensures that you will not miss events for a particular type altogether.  In addition, if there are N events in use and a new event is raised, then the oldest event is dropped and the new one is added. So the latest event is always available.  This can be further improved by adding the ability to merge the state of two events together, ensuring that no data is lost at all. This will be added in the next patch.  This also makes it possible to allow the user to determine the number of events that will be allocated. This is not implemented at the moment, but would be trivial.

Rename the header and the struct and defines in it to make this clear.  Also removed the header include in radio-si470x.h (not used anymore) and from ioctl-number.txt (it's internal to the kernel and never called from userspace).

The reason for that was that video nodes could do vbi activities: that should be separated between the vbi and video nodes.  There were also a few minor problems with dbg_g/s_register that have been resolved. The mxb/saa7146 driver now passes the v4l2_compliance tests.

I changed ->gpin_nr to signed because in gpio_ir_recv_probe() we do:         if (pdata->gpio_nr < 0)                 return -EINVAL; I also change gval to a signed int in gpio_ir_recv_irq() because that's the type that gpio_get_value_cansleep() returns and we test for negative returns.

In normal operation mode FIELD = 0 selects Field1 (odd) and FIELD = 1 selects Field2 (even). When the FIELD signal is inverted it's the other way around.  Add corresponding flags for configuring the FIELD signal polarity, V4L2_MBUS_FIELD_EVEN_HIGH for the standard (non-inverted) case and V4L2_MBUS_FIELD_EVEN_LOW for inverted case.  Also add a comment about usage of V4L2_MBUS_[HV]SYNC* flags for the hardware that uses [HV]REF signals.
