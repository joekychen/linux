The code worked this way until commit 7cfe561 "ASoC: wm8903: Expose GPIOs through gpiolib", where the behaviour was changed due to my lack of awareness of the above rationale.  This patch reverts to the intended behaviour, and updates all in-tree users to use the correct scheme. This also makes WM8903 consistent with other devices that use a similar scheme.

The driver uses an on-chip 8-bit D/A converter, which has a speaker connected to one of its channels, found in several ancient HP machines. For interrupts it uses a high-resolution timer (hrtimer). Tested on SH7709 based hp6xx (HP Jornada 680/690 and HP Palmtop 620lx/660lx).  Also, since OSS Emulation works, the old OSS sound/oss/sh_dac_audio.c driver would be obsolete soon, and it could be removed.

Similarly, the I2C device registration temporarily moves into the magician machine driver before it will find its final resting place in the board file.  At the same time, platform specific configuration is moved to platform data and common power/reset GPIO handling moves into the codec driver.

f | mpu401.h | s | 4.5K | 112 | Clemens Ladisch | clemens@ladisch.de | 1315990851 |  | ALSA: mpu401: clean up interrupt specification  The semantics of snd_mpu401_uart_new()'s interrupt parameters are somewhat counterintuitive:  To prevent the function from allocating its own interrupt, either the irq number must be invalid, or the irq_flags parameter must be zero.  At the same time, the irq parameter being invalid specifies that the mpu401 code has to work without an interrupt allocated by the caller.  This implies that, if there is an interrupt and it is allocated by the caller, the irq parameter must be set to a valid-looking number which then isn't actually used.  With the removal of IRQF_DISABLED, zero becomes a valid irq_flags value, which forces us to handle the parameters differently.  This patch introduces a new flag MPU401_INFO_IRQ_HOOK for when the device interrupt is handled by the caller, and makes the allocation of the interrupt to depend only on the irq parameter.  As suggested by Takashi, the irq_flags parameter was dropped because, when used, it had the constant value IRQF_DISABLED.
