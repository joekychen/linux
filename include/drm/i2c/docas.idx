f | ch7006.h | s | 2.2K | 76 | Ben Skeggs | bskeggs@redhat.com | 1260530974 |  | drm/nouveau: Add DRM driver for NVIDIA GPUs  This adds a drm/kms staging non-API stable driver for GPUs from NVIDIA.  This driver is a KMS-based driver and requires a compatible nouveau userspace libdrm and nouveau X.org driver.  This driver requires firmware files not available in this kernel tree, interested parties can find them via the nouveau project git archive.  This driver is reverse engineered, and is in no way supported by nVidia.  Support for nearly the complete range of nvidia hw from nv04->g80 (nv50) is available, and the kms driver should support driving nearly all output types (displayport is under development still) along with supporting suspend/resume.  This work is all from the upstream nouveau project found at nouveau.freedesktop.org.
