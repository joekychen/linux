Any driver making use of libfc can enable fdmi state machine for a given lport.  If lport has enabled FDMI support the lport state machine will transition into FDMI after completing the DNS states and before entering the SCR state. The FDMI state transition is such that if there is an error, it won't stop the lport state machine from transitioning and the it will behave as if there was no FDMI support.  The FDMI HBA attributes are registed with the Management server via Register HBA (RHBA) command and the port attributes are reigstered using the Register Port(RPA) command.

It allows VN_ports to discover each other over a loss-free L2 Ethernet without any FCF or Fibre-channel fabric services.  This is point-to-multipoint.  There is also a variant of this called point-to-point which provides for making sure there is just one pair of ports operating over the Ethernet fabric.  This patch defines the new message type and subtypes as well as one new descriptor type used by VN2VN mode.  These are all still at the proposed stage and subject to change.

The FLOGI is sent with the assigned S_ID and D_IDs of the local and remote ports.  This and the response get FIP-encapsulated for Ethernet.  Add FLOGI state to the remote port state machine. This will be skipped if not in point-to-multipoint mode.  To reduce a little duplication between PLOGI and FLOGI response handling, added fc_rport_login_complete(), which handles the parameters for the rdata struct.
