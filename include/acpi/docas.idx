f | actypes.h | s | 35K | 909 | Lin Ming | ming.m.lin@intel.com | 1336195192 |  | ACPI: Fix D3hot v D3cold confusion  Before this patch, ACPI_STATE_D3 incorrectly referenced D3hot in some places, but D3cold in other places.  After this patch, ACPI_STATE_D3 always means ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD; and all references to D3hot use ACPI_STATE_D3_HOT.  ACPI's _PR3 method is used to enter both D3hot and D3cold states. What distinguishes D3hot from D3cold is the presence _PR3 (Power Resources for D3hot)  If these resources are all ON, then the state is D3hot.  If _PR3 is not present, or all _PR0 resources for the devices are OFF, then the state is D3cold.  This patch applies after Linux-3.4-rc1. A future syntax cleanup may remove ACPI_STATE_D3 to emphasize that it always means ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD.  Signed-off-by: Lin Ming <ming.m.lin@intel.com> Acked-by: Rafael J.
