f | nfc.h | s | 5.2K | 171 | Eric Lapuyade | eric.lapuyade@intel.com | 1337117280 |  | NFC: Specify usage for targets found and target lost events  It is now specified that nfc_target_found() and nfc_target_lost() core functions must not be called from an atomic context. This allow us to serialize calls and protect the targets table using the nfc device lock instead of a spinlock.

f | nci.h | s | 10K | 305 | Ilan Elias | ilane@ti.com | 1327433549 |  | NFC: Add NCI multiple targets support  Add the ability to select between multiple targets in NCI. If only one target is found, it will be auto-activated. If more than one target is found, then DISCOVER_NTF will be generated for each target, and the host should select one by calling DISCOVER_SELECT_CMD. Then, the target will be activated. If the activation fails, GENERIC_ERROR_NTF is generated.  Signed-off-by: Ilan Elias <ilane@ti.com> Signed-off-by: John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>
