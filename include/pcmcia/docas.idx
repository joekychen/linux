Instead of config_req_t, all necessary flags are either passed as a parameter to pcmcia_enable_device(), or (in rare circumstances) set in struct pcmcia_device -> flags.  With the last remaining user of include/pcmcia/cs.h gone, remove all references.

Such cards are currently matched by orinoco_cs, which doesn't support WPA.  They should be matched by hostap_cs.  The first and the second product ID vary widely, so there are few users with some particular IDs.  Of those, very few can submit a patch for hostap_cs or write a useful bugreport.  It's still important to support their hardware properly.  With PCMCIA_DEVICE_MANF_CARD_PROD_ID3, it should be possible to cover the remaining Intersil based designs that kept the numeric ID and the "version" of the reference design.

This header file also serves as the dumping ground for all typedefs and definitions only used by the deprecated PCMCIA ioctl and the deprecated PCMCIA userspace tools using this ioctl.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
