Instead, the bpf-direct sample should now compile on any architecture, but if the architecture is not supported, it will compile a minimal main() function.  This change also ensures the samples are not compiled when there is no seccomp filter support.  (Note, I wasn't able to reproduce the error locally, but  the existing approach was clearly flawed.  This tweak  should resolve your issue and avoid other future weirdness.)

d | block |  | 33 items |  | Jan Kara | jack@suse.cz | 1339757566 |  | scsi: Silence unnecessary warnings about ioctl to partition  Sometimes, warnings about ioctls to partition happen often enough that they form majority of the warnings in the kernel log and users complain. In some cases warnings are about ioctls such as SG_IO so it's not good to get rid of the warnings completely as they can ease debugging of userspace problems when ioctl is refused.  Since I have seen warnings from lots of commands, including some proprietary userspace applications, I don't think disallowing the ioctls for processes with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will happen in the near future if ever. So lets just stop warning for processes with CAP_SYS_RAWIO for which ioctl is allowed.

When using SYSV IPC shared memory segments, calling madvise with the MADV_REMOVE advice on an area of shared memory will attempt to invoke the .fallocate function for the shm_file_operations, which is NULL and therefore returns -EOPNOTSUPP to userspace.  The previous behaviour would inherit the inode_operations from the underlying tmpfs file and invoke truncate_range there.  This patch restores the previous behaviour by wrapping the underlying fallocate function in shm_fallocate, as we do for fsync.
