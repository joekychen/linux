f | tg1.bin.ihex | g | 196K |  | Jaswinder Singh | jaswinder@infradead.org | 1231114202 |  | firmware: convert acenic driver to request_firmware()  We store the firmware in its native big-endian form now, so the loop in ace_copy() is modified to use be32_to_cpup() when writing it out.  We can forget the BSS,SBSS sections of the firmware, since we were clearing all the device's RAM anyway. And the text,rodata,data sections can all be loaded as a single chunk since they're contiguous (give or take a few dozen bytes in between).
