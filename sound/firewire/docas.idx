f | iso-resources.h | s | 1.2K | 32 | Stefan Richter | stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de | 1305060824 |  | firewire: octlet AT payloads can be stack-allocated  We do not need slab allocations anymore in order to satisfy streaming DMA mapping constraints, thanks to commit da28947e7e36 "firewire: ohci: avoid separate DMA mapping for small AT payloads".  (Besides, the slab-allocated buffers that firewire-core, firewire-sbp2, and firedtv used to provide for 8-byte write and lock requests were still not fully portable since they crossed cacheline boundaries or shared a cacheline with unrelated CPU-accessed data.  snd-firewire-lib got this aspect right by using an extra kmalloc/ kfree just for the 8-byte transaction buffer.)  This change replaces kmalloc'ed lock transaction scratch buffers in firewire-core, firedtv, and snd-firewire-lib by local stack allocations. Perhaps the most notable result of the change is simpler locking because there is no need to serialize usages of preallocated per-device buffers anymore.  Also, allocations and deallocations are simpler.  Signed-off-by: Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de> Acked-by: Clemens Ladisch <clemens@ladisch.de>
