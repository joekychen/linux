The driver also requires a SPI to setup the registers and control volume. It has been tested with an AT32AP7000 on the ATSTK1000 development board. The driver should also work with any Atmel device with an SSC module supported by the Atmel SSC driver (atmel-ssc). The atmel-ssc driver is just submitted to the Linux kernel.
