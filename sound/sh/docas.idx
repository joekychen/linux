The module_platform_driver() conversion ended up tripping over the driver name, leading to confusion in the macro with regards to 'driver' being redefined. rename it to something slightly more suitable to avoid namespace collisions.  sound/sh/sh_dac_audio.c:444:122: error: conflicting types for 'driver_init' include/linux/device.h:773:6: note: previous declaration of 'driver_init' was here make[3]: *** [sound/sh/sh_dac_audio.o] Error 1  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org> Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
f | Kconfig | g | 667B |  | Rafael Ignacio Zurita | rizurita@yahoo.com | 1257322660 |  | ALSA: sh: add SuperH DAC audio driver for ALSA V4  This is a port of the sound/oss/sh_dac_audio.c driver. The driver uses an on-chip 8-bit D/A converter, which has a speaker connected to one of its channels, found in several ancient HP machines. For interrupts it uses a high-resolution timer (hrtimer). Tested on SH7709 based hp6xx (HP Jornada 680/690 and HP Palmtop 620lx/660lx).  Also, since OSS Emulation works, the old OSS sound/oss/sh_dac_audio.c driver would be obsolete soon, and it could be removed.

f | aica.h | s | 2.3K | 71 | Adrian McMenamin | adrian@mcmen.demon.co.uk | 1185251455 |  | sh: Fix Dreamcast DMA issues.  The current SH DMA API is somewhat broken, not correctly matching virtual channel to the correct SH DMAC. This wasn't noticeable when using g2 DMA for the sound driver - one channel 0 is as good as any other! - but caused the pvr2 driver to fail.  This patch fixes the pvr2 problem and consequently fixes the sound driver to ensure it continues to function.
