f | ad1848.c | s | 5.3K | 160 | Rusty Russell | rusty@rustcorp.com.au | 1324287281 |  | ALSA: module_param: make bool parameters really bool  module_param(bool) used to counter-intuitively take an int.  In fddd5201 (mid-2009) we allowed bool or int/unsigned int using a messy trick.  It's time to remove the int/unsigned int option.  For this version it'll simply give a warning, but it'll break next kernel version.  Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au> Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

The library is fully assimilated into the new wss library.  This required reworking of the AD1848 family code so the code is changed to correctly detect chips from the AD1848 and CS4231 families.  I have tested it on following cards: Gallant SC-6600 (codec: AD1848, driver: snd-sc6600) SoundScape VIVO/90 (codec: AD1845, driver: snd-sscape) SG Waverider (codec: CS4231A, driver: Rene Herman's snd-galaxy) Opti930 (codec: built-in - CS4231 compatible, driver: snd-opti93x) Opti931 (codec: built-in - CS4231 compatible, driver: snd-opti93x) Gallant SC-70P (chip/codec: CS4237B, driver: snd-cs4236) Audio Plus 3D (chip/codec: CMI8330A, driver: snd-cmi8330) Dell Latitude CP (chip/codec: cs4236, driver snd-cs4232)  Sound playback and recording works on all these cards.
