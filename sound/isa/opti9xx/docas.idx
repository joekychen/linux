f | miro.c | s | 39K | 1414 | Rusty Russell | rusty@rustcorp.com.au | 1324287281 |  | ALSA: module_param: make bool parameters really bool  module_param(bool) used to counter-intuitively take an int.  In fddd5201 (mid-2009) we allowed bool or int/unsigned int using a messy trick.  It's time to remove the int/unsigned int option.  For this version it'll simply give a warning, but it'll break next kernel version.  Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au> Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
