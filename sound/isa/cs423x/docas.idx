In fddd5201 (mid-2009) we allowed bool or int/unsigned int using a messy trick.  It's time to remove the int/unsigned int option.  For this version it'll simply give a warning, but it'll break next kernel version.  Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au> Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

Let's merge it into the main driver as well.  Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
