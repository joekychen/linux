In fddd5201 (mid-2009) we allowed bool or int/unsigned int using a messy trick.  It's time to remove the int/unsigned int option.  For this version it'll simply give a warning, but it'll break next kernel version.  Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au> Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

It's constructed as two seperate drivers for either chipset generated from the same source file, with (very) minimal ifdeffery.  The drivers check the SB DSP version to decide if they are being loaded for the right chip. AZT1605 returns 2.1 by default and AZT2316 3.1. This isn't full-proof as the DSP version can actually be set through software but it's close enough -- as far as I've been able to see, the DSP version can not be stored in the EEPROM and the cards will therefore startup with the defaults.  This distinction could (with the same success rate) also be used to decide which chip we're looking at at runtime meaning a single, merged driver is also an option but I feel it's actually nicer this way. A merged driver would have to postpone translating the passed in resource values to the card configuration until it knew which one it was looking at and would need to postpone erring out on mpu_irq=10 for azt1605 and mpu_irq=3 for azt2316.  The drivers have been tested on various cards. For snd-azt1605:  FCC-ID I38-MMSN811: Aztech Sound Galaxy Nova 16 Extra FCC-ID I38-MMSN822: Aztech Sound Galaxy Pro 16 II  and for snd-azt2316:  FCC-ID I38-MMSN824: Aztech Sound Galaxy Pro 16 AB FCC-ID I38-MMSN826: Trust Sound Expert DeLuxe Wave 32 (05201) FCC-ID I38-MMSN830: Trust Sound Expert DeLuxe 16+ (05202) FCC-ID I38-MMSN837: Packard Bell ISA Soundcard 030069 FCC-ID I38-MMSN846: Trust Sound Expert DeLuxe 16-3D (06300) FCC-ID I38-MMSN847: Trust Sound Expert DeLuxe Wave 32-3D (06301) FCC-ID I38-MMSN852: Aztech Sound Galaxy Waverider Pro 32-3D  826 and 846 were also marketed directly by Aztech and then known as:  FCC-ID I38-MMSN826: Aztech Sound Galaxy Waverider 32+ FCC-ID I38-MMSN846: Aztech Sound Galaxy Nova 16 Extra II-3D  Together, these cover the AZT1605 and AT2316A, AZT2316R and AZT2316-S chipsets. All cards work fully -- full-duplex PCM, MIDI and FM. Full duplex is a little flaky on some.  I38-MSN811 tends to not work in full-duplex but sometimes does with the highest success rate being achieved when you first start the capture and then a playback instead of the other way around (it's a CS4231-KL codec).  The cards with an AD1845XP codec (my I38-MMSN826 and one of my I38-MMSN830s) are also somewhat duplex-challenged. Sometimes full-duplex works, sometimes not and this varies from try to try. This seems likely to be a timing problem somewhere inside wss-lib.  I38-MMSN826 has an additional "ICS2115 WaveFront" wavetable synth onboard that isn't supported yet. The wavetable synths on I38-MMSN847 and I38-MMSN852 are wired directly to the standard MPU-401 UART and the AUX1 input on the codec and work without problem.  CD-ROM audio on the cards is routed to the codec "Line" input, Line-In to its Aux input, and FM/Wavetable to its AUX1 input. I did not rename the controls due to the capture source enumeration: I see that capture-source overrides are hardcoded in wss-lib and this is just too ugly to live.  Versus the old snd-sgalaxy driver these drivers add support for the models without a configuration EEPROM (which are common), full-duplex, MPU-401 UART and OPL3. In the future they might grow support for that ICS2115 WaveFront synth on 826 and an hwdep interface to write to the EEPROM on the models that have one.
