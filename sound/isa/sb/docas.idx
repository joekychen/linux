f | Makefile | g | 928B |  | Krzysztof Helt | krzysztof.h1@wp.pl | 1273477770 |  | ALSA: Merge es1688 and es968 drivers  The ESS ES968 chip is nothing more then a PnP companion for a non-PnP audio chip. It was paired with non-PnP ESS' chips: ES688 and ES1688. The ESS' audio chips are handled by the es1688 driver in native mode. The PnP cards are handled by the ES968 driver in SB compatible mode.  Move the ES968 chip handling to the es1688 driver so the driver can handle both PnP and non-PnP cards. The es968 is removed.  Also, a new PnP id is added for the card I acquired (the change was tested on this card).  Signed-off-by: Krzysztof Helt <krzysztof.h1@wp.pl> Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
