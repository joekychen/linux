Description from 53dea36c70c1857:  Don't rely on the codec's channels_min information to decide wheter or  not allocate a substream's DMA buffer. Rather check if the substream  itself was allocated previously.  Without this patch I was seeing null-pointer dereferenc in atmel-pcm.

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.  This patch changes the probe() and remove() of the CODEC drivers as follows:-   o Make CODEC driver a platform driver  o Moved all struct snd_soc_codec list, mutex, etc initialiasation to core.  o Removed all static codec pointers (drivers now support > 1 codec dev)  o snd_soc_register_pcms() now done by core.  o snd_soc_register_dai() folded into snd_soc_register_codec().

The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.  This patch changes the probe() and remove() of the CODEC drivers as follows:-   o Make CODEC driver a platform driver  o Moved all struct snd_soc_codec list, mutex, etc initialiasation to core.  o Removed all static codec pointers (drivers now support > 1 codec dev)  o snd_soc_register_pcms() now done by core.  o snd_soc_register_dai() folded into snd_soc_register_codec().
