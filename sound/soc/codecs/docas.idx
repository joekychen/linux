This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.  This patch changes the probe() and remove() of the CODEC drivers as follows:-   o Make CODEC driver a platform driver  o Moved all struct snd_soc_codec list, mutex, etc initialiasation to core.  o Removed all static codec pointers (drivers now support > 1 codec dev)  o snd_soc_register_pcms() now done by core.  o snd_soc_register_dai() folded into snd_soc_register_codec().

This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.

It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.

f | wm8991.c | s | 43K | 1207 | Liam Girdwood | lrg@ti.com | 1328359211 |  | ASoC: core: Add support for DAI and machine kcontrols.  Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.  This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing calls (card and dai are new) :-  snd_soc_add_card_controls() snd_soc_add_codec_controls() snd_soc_add_dai_controls() snd_soc_add_platform_controls()  This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().  It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.  In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer via the codec pointer).

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform.

All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.

Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.  This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing calls (card and dai are new) :-  snd_soc_add_card_controls() snd_soc_add_codec_controls() snd_soc_add_dai_controls() snd_soc_add_platform_controls()  This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().  It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.  In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer via the codec pointer).

Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.  This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing calls (card and dai are new) :-  snd_soc_add_card_controls() snd_soc_add_codec_controls() snd_soc_add_dai_controls() snd_soc_add_platform_controls()  This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().  It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.  In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer via the codec pointer).

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device.

Thanks to the regulator sharing mechanism, both the old (the sound card) and the new (the codec) implementations should coexist smoothly until the sound card file is updated.

f | max9877.c | s | 8.0K | 254 | Liam Girdwood | lrg@ti.com | 1328359211 |  | ASoC: core: Add support for DAI and machine kcontrols.  Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.  This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing calls (card and dai are new) :-  snd_soc_add_card_controls() snd_soc_add_codec_controls() snd_soc_add_dai_controls() snd_soc_add_platform_controls()  This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().  It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.  In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer via the codec pointer).

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.  This patch changes the probe() and remove() of the CODEC drivers as follows:-   o Make CODEC driver a platform driver  o Moved all struct snd_soc_codec list, mutex, etc initialiasation to core.  o Removed all static codec pointers (drivers now support > 1 codec dev)  o snd_soc_register_pcms() now done by core.  o snd_soc_register_dai() folded into snd_soc_register_codec().

Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.  This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing calls (card and dai are new) :-  snd_soc_add_card_controls() snd_soc_add_codec_controls() snd_soc_add_dai_controls() snd_soc_add_platform_controls()  This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().  It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.  In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer via the codec pointer).

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.  This patch changes the probe() and remove() of the CODEC drivers as follows:-   o Make CODEC driver a platform driver  o Moved all struct snd_soc_codec list, mutex, etc initialiasation to core.  o Removed all static codec pointers (drivers now support > 1 codec dev)  o snd_soc_register_pcms() now done by core.  o snd_soc_register_dai() folded into snd_soc_register_codec().

Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.  This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing calls (card and dai are new) :-  snd_soc_add_card_controls() snd_soc_add_codec_controls() snd_soc_add_dai_controls() snd_soc_add_platform_controls()  This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().  It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.  In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer via the codec pointer).

This is achieved by dividing some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.   struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)                           +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)   struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted  This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.  The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.  This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.  Other notable multi-component changes:-   * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.  * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs    in a card.  * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms    per sound card.  * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.  * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove    DAI link components.  * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.  * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().  * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.  This patch changes the probe() and remove() of the CODEC drivers as follows:-   o Make CODEC driver a platform driver  o Moved all struct snd_soc_codec list, mutex, etc initialiasation to core.  o Removed all static codec pointers (drivers now support > 1 codec dev)  o snd_soc_register_pcms() now done by core.  o snd_soc_register_dai() folded into snd_soc_register_codec().

Currently ASoC can only add kcontrols using codec and platform component device handles. It's also desirable to add kcontrols for DAIs (i.e. McBSP) and for SoC card machine drivers too. This allows the kcontrol to have a direct handle to the parent ASoC component DAI/SoC Card/Platform/Codec device and hence easily get it's private data.  This change makes snd_soc_add_controls() static and wraps it in the folowing calls (card and dai are new) :-  snd_soc_add_card_controls() snd_soc_add_codec_controls() snd_soc_add_dai_controls() snd_soc_add_platform_controls()  This patch also does a lot of small mechanical changes in individual codec drivers to replace snd_soc_add_controls() with snd_soc_add_codec_controls().  It also updates the McBSP DAI driver to use snd_soc_add_dai_controls().  Finally, it updates the existing machine drivers that register controls to either :-  1) Use snd_soc_add_card_controls() where no direct codec control is required. 2) Use snd_soc_add_codec_controls() where there is direct codec control.  In the case of 1) above we also update the machine drivers to get the correct component data pointers from the kcontrol (rather than getting the machine pointer via the codec pointer).
