Also use it in the sam9g20-ek driver.  Signed-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com> Acked-by: Liam Girdwood <lrg@slimlogic.co.uk>

That support depends on BOARD_PLAYPAQ. That Kconfig symbol didn't exist when that support got added in v2.6.27. It still doesn't. It has never been possible to even build this driver. Drop it.

This patch remove the "select ATMEL_SSC" from SND_ATMEL_SOC_SSC to avoid above warnings. And then ensures all the machine drivers that select SND_ATMEL_SOC_SSC need to depend on ATMEL_SSC.
