The following structure elements duplicate the information in 'struct device.of_node' and so are being eliminated.  This patch makes all readers of these elements use device.of_node instead.  (struct of_device *)->node (struct dev_archdata *)->prom_node (sparc) (struct dev_archdata *)->of_node (powerpc & microblaze)  Signed-off-by: Grant Likely <grant.likely@secretlab.ca>

Done via coccinelle scripts like:  @@ struct resource *ptr; @@  - ptr->end - ptr->start + 1 + resource_size(ptr)  and some grep and typing.  Mostly uncompiled, no cross-compilers.
