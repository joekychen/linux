So fix up those users now.  Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>

f | Makefile | g | 139B |  | Johannes Berg | johannes@sipsolutions.net | 1151004878 |  | [ALSA] snd-aoa: add snd-aoa  This large patch adds all of snd-aoa. Consisting of many modules, it currently replaces snd-powermac for all layout-id based machines and handles many more (for example new powerbooks and powermacs with digital output that previously couldn't be used at all). It also has support for all layout-IDs that Apple has (judging from their Info.plist file) but not all are tested. The driver currently has 2 known regressions over snd-powermac:  * it doesn't handle powermac 7,2 and 7,3  * it doesn't have a DRC control on snapper-based machines I will fix those during the 2.6.18 development cycle.
