On a big endian system the current code will set ->size to zero.  We fixed a similar bug on the next line but missed this one.

Also, a large majority of the callers do not check the return code of pci_restore_state.  Make the pci_restore_state a void return and avoid the overhead.

This was because the old geode GPIO code was written in a manner that assumed CONFIG_MGEODE_LX.  With the new cs553x-gpio driver, this is no longer the case; as such, we can drop the requirement on CONFIG_MGEODE_LX and instead include a requirement on GPIOLIB.  We use the generic GPIO API rather than the cs553x-specific API.
