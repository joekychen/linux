It seems to me that we don't always free the various memory buffers we allocate and we also do some work (structure member assignment) early, that is completely pointless if some of the memory allocations fail and we end up just aborting the whole thing.  I don't have hardware to test, so the patch below is compile tested only, but it makes the following changes:  - Make sure we always free all allocated memory on failures. - Don't do pointless work assigning to structure members before we know   all memory allocations, that may abort progress, have completed   successfully. - Remove some trailing whitespace.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
