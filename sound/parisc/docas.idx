f | harmony.c | s | 25K | 867 | Julia Lawall | julia@diku.dk | 1256900498 |  | ALSA: sound/parisc: Move dereference after NULL test  If the NULL test on h is needed in snd_harmony_mixer_init, then the dereference should be after the NULL test.  Actually, there is a sequence of calls: snd_harmony_create, then snd_harmony_pcm_init, and then snd_harmony_mixer_init.  snd_harmony_create initializes h, but may indeed leave it as NULL.  There was no NULL test at the beginning of snd_harmony_pcm_init, so I have added one.  The NULL test in snd_harmony_mixer_init is then not necessary, but in case the ordering of the calls changes, I have left it, and moved the dereference after it.  A simplified version of the semantic match that detects this problem is as follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):  // <smpl> @match exists@ expression x, E; identifier fld; @@  * x->fld   ... when != \(x = E\||&x\) * x == NULL // </smpl>  Signed-off-by: Julia Lawall <julia@diku.dk> Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
