f | Makefile | g | 374B |  | Dmitry Artamonow | mad_soft@inbox.ru | 1237309093 |  | ALSA: drop outdated and broken sa11xx-uda1341 driver  It depends on L3 support from 2.4 kernel (CONFIG_L3) that never got merged into mainline. Since there's no way to use it on any of supported machines (iPaq h3100 or h3600), better drop it for now. It can be reimplemented later using ASoC infrastructure (there's already a driver for uda1341 codec in mainline, so only CPU and machine parts need to be written).
