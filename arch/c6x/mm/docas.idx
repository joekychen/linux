Brought up to date by Mark Salter <msalter@redhat.com>  The C6X architecture currently lacks an MMU so memory management is relatively simple. There is no bus snooping between L2 and main memory but coherent DMA memory is supported by making regions of main memory uncached. If such a region is desired, it can be specified on the commandline with a "memdma=" argument.
