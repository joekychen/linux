d | kernel |  | 20 items |  | Al Viro | viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk | 1338569932 |  | new helper: signal_delivered()  Does block_sigmask() + tracehook_signal_handler();  called when sigframe has been successfully built.  All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

d | boot |  | 3 items |  | Stephen Warren | swarren@nvidia.com | 1329272084 |  | Kbuild: Use dtc's -d (dependency) option  This hooks dtc into Kbuild's dependency system.  Thus, for example, "make dtbs" will rebuild tegra-harmony.dtb if only tegra20.dtsi has changed yet tegra-harmony.dts has not. The previous lack of this feature recently caused me to have very confusing "git bisect" results.  For ARM, it's obvious what to add to $(targets). I'm not familiar enough with other architectures to know what to add there. Powerpc appears to already add various .dtb files into $(targets), but the other archs may need something added to $(targets) to work.

Outside x86 we have a small s390 and a very large ppc   update.    Regarding the new (for kvm) rebaseless workflow, some of the patches   that were merged before we switch trees had to be rebased, while   others are true pulls.  In either case the signoffs should be correct   now."  Fix up trivial conflicts in Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_segment.S and arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_para.h.

Brought up to date by Mark Salter <msalter@redhat.com>  The C6X architecture currently lacks an MMU so memory management is relatively simple. There is no bus snooping between L2 and main memory but coherent DMA memory is supported by making regions of main memory uncached. If such a region is desired, it can be specified on the commandline with a "memdma=" argument.
