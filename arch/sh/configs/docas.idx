The userspace has to manually create a cgroup and add a task to   the 'tasks' file.  This patch removes the ns_cgroup as suggested in the following thread:  https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2009-June/018616.html  The 'cgroup_clone' function is removed because it is no longer used.  This is a userspace-visible change.  Commit 45531757b45c ("cgroup: notify ns_cgroup deprecated") (merged into 2.6.27) caused the kernel to emit a printk warning users that the feature is planned for removal.  Since that time we have heard from XXX users who were affected by this.  Signed-off-by: Daniel Lezcano <daniel.lezcano@free.fr> Signed-off-by: Serge E. Hallyn <serge.hallyn@canonical.com> Cc: Eric W.
