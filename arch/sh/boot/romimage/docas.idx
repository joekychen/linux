f | mmcif-sh7724.c | s | 2.0K | 55 | Simon Horman | horms@verge.net.au | 1300983897 |  | mmc: Add MMC_PROGRESS_*  This is my second attempt to make this enum generally available. The first attempt added MMCIF_PROGRESS_* to include/linux/mmc/sh_mmcif.h. However this is not sufficiently generic as the enum will be used by SDHI boot code.
