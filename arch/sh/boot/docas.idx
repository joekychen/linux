Move it to Makefile.lib to avoid duplication.  All ARCHs have similar definitions of cmd_uimage. Place a sufficiently parameterized version in Makefile.lib to avoid duplication.

d | compressed |  | 8 items |  | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1307350678 |  | sh: Remove compressed kernel libgcc dependency.  SH-2A is unable to combine the kernel and libgcc objects due to fundamental disagreements over FDPIC settings. As the kernel already contains all of the libgcc bits broken out, there's not much need to bother with the linking anymore, as everything can already be derived from the lib dir.  This simply plugs in the necessary bits to ensure that everything is built uniformly, enabling us to wean the compressed build off of explicit libgcc linking.

The first attempt added MMCIF_PROGRESS_* to include/linux/mmc/sh_mmcif.h. However this is not sufficiently generic as the enum will be used by SDHI boot code.
