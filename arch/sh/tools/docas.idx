f | Makefile | g | 451B |  | Michal Marek | mmarek@suse.cz | 1263385644 |  | Makefile: do not override LC_CTYPE  Setting LC_CTYPE=C breaks localized messages in some setups. With only LC_COLLATE=C and LC_NUMERIC=C, we get almost all we need, except for not so defined character classes and tolower()/toupper(). The former is not a big issue, because we can assume that e.g. [:alpha:] will always include a-zA-Z and we only ever process ASCII input. The latter seems only affect arch/sh/tools/gen-mach-types, which we can handle separately.  So after this patch the meaning of ranges like [a-z], the behavior of sort and join, etc. should be the same everywhere and at the same time gcc should be able to print localized waring and error messages. LC_NUMERIC=C might not be necessary, but setting it doesn't hurt.  Reported-by: Simon Horman <horms@verge.net.au> Reported-by: Sergei Trofimovich <slyfox@inbox.ru> Acked-by: H.
