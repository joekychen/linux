f | fpga.h | s | 4.0K | 132 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1292579884 |  | sh: mach-sdk7786: Handle baseboard NMI source selection.  The on-board NMI switch is routed through and mangled by the FPGA prior to its delivery to the NMI pin, so add some glue for the various configuration options. The default is to unmask it and enable all input sources.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>

This moves out the FPGA IRQ controller setup code to its own file, in preparation for switching off of IRL mode and having it provide its own irq_chip.
