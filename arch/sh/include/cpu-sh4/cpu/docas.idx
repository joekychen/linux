f | sq.h | s | 1.2K | 31 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1266380580 |  | sh: Fix up more 64-bit pgprot truncation on SH-X2 TLB.  Both the store queue API and the PMB remapping take unsigned long for their pgprot flags, which cuts off the extended protection bits. In the case of the PMB this isn't really a problem since the cache attribute bits that we care about are all in the lower 32-bits, but we do it just to be safe. The store queue remapping on the other hand depends on the extended prot bits for enabling userspace access to the mappings.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>

For starters, kill off the stubs for the CPUs that don't do anything, as well as all of the unused definitions. This leaves us with a set of IRQs and base addresses we can deal with later.

This just utilizes a simple loop that scans across all of the fixed physical areas (area 0 through area 6) to locate the FPGA.  The FPGA also contains register information detailing the area mappings and chip select settings for all of the other blocks, so this needs to be done before we can set up anything else.
