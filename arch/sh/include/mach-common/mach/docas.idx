The microdev only has to contend with silly PIO mangling on anything within the SuperIO range. As each of the SuperIO modules is already speciail cased, we just shift that logic over to the ioport map.  With microdev PCI never being merged (and being fudamentally broken in hardware), and the ethernet chip only doing 16-bit accesses already, there's no need to maintain any of the extra special casing. Kill it all off.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>

This patch series adds support for ITO Co., Ltd.'s SH-2007 reference platform (A PC-104 based SH7780 platform).  This is a direct port of the out-of-tree board support from the vendor's kernel, originally located at:  	http://ms-n.org/sh-linux/kernel/  More information on the board and the vendor can be obtained from the vendor's site at:  	http://www.itonet.co.jp/  Presently supported peripherals are CF and ethernet, with support for the on-board IDE still pending further testing.

The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that future users are not added.

This adopts a trimmed down version of the MIPS port mangling interface limited to the I/O swabbing for platforms that can't use little endian accessors. For platforms with mixed I/O spaces involving PCI it will still be necessary to enable byte swapping at the host controller level. Attention needs to be paid to all of host controller endianness, CPU endianness, and whether I/O accesses are explicitly swapped or not via SWAP_IO_SPACE. Fortunately the platforms that need this are in the minority.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
