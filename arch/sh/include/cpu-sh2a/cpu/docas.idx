f | addrspace.h | s | 251B | 8 | Takashi Yoshii | yoshii.takashi@renesas.com | 1217828359 |  | add addrespace definition for sh2a.  Newfile: arch/sh/include/cpu-sh2a/cpu/addrspace.h  This file seems had be removed to use fallback (cpu-common/cpu/addrspace.h), but, I'd like to add sh2a specific file here, because 1. the values defined there are not suitable for sh2a. 2. I don't think there is "common" definition for these values.  Values are chosen by consideration of followings...  P1 is 0. perhaps no question.  P2 is from hardware manual, which says no-cache area starts at 20000000.  It means that P? space size=20000000.  P3 is P2+size since asm/ptrace.h uses P3 as a end of P2.  P4 is P3+size since asm/fixup.h uses P4 as a end of P3.  Signed-off-by: Takashi YOSHII <yoshii.takashi@renesas.com> Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
