The dma-sh case inadvertently broke the dreamcast case by testing the wrong variable for the total number of channels, so this fixes that up too.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>

This has turned in to quite a mess, and with CPUs that care using dmaengine now it's about time to start cleaning up after the legacy DMA code. For starters, kill off the stubs for the CPUs that don't do anything, as well as all of the unused definitions. This leaves us with a set of IRQs and base addresses we can deal with later.

Attempt to "tidy" up some of the multi IRQ handling and base + IRQ management.
