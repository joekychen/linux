f | watchdog.h | s | 1.7K | 61 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1264478320 |  | sh: Mass ctrl_in/outX to __raw_read/writeX conversion.  The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that future users are not added.
