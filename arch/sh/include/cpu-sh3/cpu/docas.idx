f | serial.h | s | 278B | 7 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1308022819 |  | serial: sh-sci: Abstract register maps.  This takes a bit of a sledgehammer to the horribly CPU subtype ifdef-ridden header and abstracts all of the different register layouts in to distinct types which in turn can be overriden on a per-port basis, or permitted to default to the map matching the port type at probe time.  In the process this ultimately fixes up inumerable bugs with mismatches on various CPU types (particularly the legacy ones that were obviously broken years ago and no one noticed) and provides a more tightly coupled and consolidated platform for extending and implementing generic features.

This has turned in to quite a mess, and with CPUs that care using dmaengine now it's about time to start cleaning up after the legacy DMA code. For starters, kill off the stubs for the CPUs that don't do anything, as well as all of the unused definitions. This leaves us with a set of IRQs and base addresses we can deal with later.

As SH-3 parts lack a split TLB, the same global flush behaviour is accomplished through the flush bit, which just happens to be the same as on SH-4.  This fixes up the build for all SH-3 MMU parts.

The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that future users are not added.
