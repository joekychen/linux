f | dma.h | s | 2.5K | 69 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1337427530 |  | sh: dma: More legacy cpu dma chainsawing.  Attempt to "tidy" up some of the multi IRQ handling and base + IRQ management. This should keep it limping along without too much hassle, and no new parts should ever be enabling or using this API anyways.  It doesn't get any closer to lipstick on a pig as this.

f | serial.h | s | 190B | 5 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1308022819 |  | serial: sh-sci: Abstract register maps.  This takes a bit of a sledgehammer to the horribly CPU subtype ifdef-ridden header and abstracts all of the different register layouts in to distinct types which in turn can be overriden on a per-port basis, or permitted to default to the map matching the port type at probe time.  In the process this ultimately fixes up inumerable bugs with mismatches on various CPU types (particularly the legacy ones that were obviously broken years ago and no one noticed) and provides a more tightly coupled and consolidated platform for extending and implementing generic features.
