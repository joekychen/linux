f | setup.c | s | 1.9K | 73 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1337590441 |  | sh: Kill off machvec IRQ hinting.  Everything is using sparseirq these days, so we have no need to arbitrarily size nr_irqs ahead of time. The legacy IRQ pre-allocation likewise has no meaning for us, so that's killed off too. We now depend on nr_irqs expansion by the generic hardirq layer instead.  It's also worth noting that the majority of boards had completely bogus values for their nr_irqs relative to their CPU and configurations, so this ends up correcting behaviour for quite a few platforms.

This flattens out the board directories in to individual mach groups, we will use this for getting rid of unneeded directories, simplifying the build system, and becoming more coherent with the refactored arch/sh/include topology.
