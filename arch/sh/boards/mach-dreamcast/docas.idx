The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that future users are not added.

This flattens out the board directories in to individual mach groups, we will use this for getting rid of unneeded directories, simplifying the build system, and becoming more coherent with the refactored arch/sh/include topology.
