f | setup.c | s | 1.3K | 52 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1337590441 |  | sh: Kill off machvec IRQ hinting.  Everything is using sparseirq these days, so we have no need to arbitrarily size nr_irqs ahead of time. The legacy IRQ pre-allocation likewise has no meaning for us, so that's killed off too. We now depend on nr_irqs expansion by the generic hardirq layer instead.  It's also worth noting that the majority of boards had completely bogus values for their nr_irqs relative to their CPU and configurations, so this ends up correcting behaviour for quite a few platforms.

If support is added in the future it can be taken care of via platform data like on the others.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
