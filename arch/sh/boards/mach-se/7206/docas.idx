f | setup.c | s | 2.0K | 83 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1337590441 |  | sh: Kill off machvec IRQ hinting.  Everything is using sparseirq these days, so we have no need to arbitrarily size nr_irqs ahead of time. The legacy IRQ pre-allocation likewise has no meaning for us, so that's killed off too. We now depend on nr_irqs expansion by the generic hardirq layer instead.  It's also worth noting that the majority of boards had completely bogus values for their nr_irqs relative to their CPU and configurations, so this ends up correcting behaviour for quite a few platforms.

Given that the SMC ethernet is already properly handled and that nothing is using the MRSHPC, none of this is needed.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
