f | setup.c | s | 4.2K | 166 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1337590441 |  | sh: Kill off machvec IRQ hinting.  Everything is using sparseirq these days, so we have no need to arbitrarily size nr_irqs ahead of time. The legacy IRQ pre-allocation likewise has no meaning for us, so that's killed off too. We now depend on nr_irqs expansion by the generic hardirq layer instead.  It's also worth noting that the majority of boards had completely bogus values for their nr_irqs relative to their CPU and configurations, so this ends up correcting behaviour for quite a few platforms.

f | irq.c | s | 2.3K | 101 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1264478320 |  | sh: Mass ctrl_in/outX to __raw_read/writeX conversion.  The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that future users are not added.
