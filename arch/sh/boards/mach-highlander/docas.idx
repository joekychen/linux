The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that future users are not added.

These operated on the assumption that GENERIC_GPIO support with an optional GPIOLIB was possible. This used to be true, but has not been the case since commit-id d56cc8bc661ac1ceded8d45ba2d53bb134fee17d ("sh: use gpiolib"), where the GENERIC_GPIO implementation was rewritten to use GPIOLIB directly.
