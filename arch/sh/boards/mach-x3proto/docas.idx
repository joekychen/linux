f | setup.c | s | 5.8K | 246 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1286128849 |  | sh: mach-x3proto: gpio-keys support.  This adds gpio-keys mappings for the button matrix on the baseboard, now that we have support for the pin controller.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
f | ilsel.c | s | 4.1K | 134 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1286129269 |  | sh: mach-x3proto: Improve ILSEL debugging.  At the moment ILSEL blows up with a BUG when aliased sets are handed in, but as the enable call is able to hand back errors we opt for that path instead. None of the ILSEL peripherals are vital to the board's operation, so trapping a BUG is a bit excessive.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
f | Makefile | g | 63B |  | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1286128769 |  | sh: mach-x3proto: Support for baseboard GPIOs.  This adds trivial support for the GPIOs implemented through the baseboard CPLD, used for driving the button matrix.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
