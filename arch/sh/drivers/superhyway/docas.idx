The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that future users are not added.

This depends on the earlier SuperHyway patch for multiple block support and VCR refactoring.
