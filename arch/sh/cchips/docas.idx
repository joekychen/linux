f | Kconfig | g | 1012B |  | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1242356584 |  | sh: hd64461: Fix up I/O base register offsets.  hd64461 is mapped in a fixed location, so the I/O base itself is fairly meaningless as a configuration item. Additionally, this makes it impossible to share hd64461 code alongside generic drivers (in the case of sh_dac_audio), so simply make it commonly defined and permit the mach_is_foo() logic to work out the proper semantics.
