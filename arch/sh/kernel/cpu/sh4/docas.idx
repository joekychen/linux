f | perf_event.c | s | 6.2K | 241 | Peter Zijlstra | peterz@infradead.org | 1309511198 |  | perf, arch: Add generic NODE cache events  Add a NODE level to the generic cache events which is used to measure local vs remote memory accesses. Like all other cache events, an ACCESS is HIT+MISS, if there is no way to distinguish between reads and writes do reads only etc..  The below needs filling out for !x86 (which I filled out with unsupported events).  I'm fairly sure ARM can leave it like that since it doesn't strike me as an architecture that even has NUMA support. SH might have something since it does appear to have some NUMA bits.  Sparc64, PowerPC and MIPS certainly want a good look there since they clearly are NUMA capable.
