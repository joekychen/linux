f | Makefile | g | 312B |  | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1241687427 |  | sh: Integrate the SH-5 onchip_remap() more coherently.  Presently this is special-cased for early initialization. While there are situations where these static early initializations are still necessary, with minor changes it is possible to use this for the regular ioremap implementation as well. This allows us to kill off the special-casing for the remap completely and to start tidying up all of the SH-5 special-casing in drivers.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>

f | fpu.c | s | 3.5K | 103 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1334825540 |  | sh64: Kill off unused trap_no/error_code from thread_struct.  While the trap number and error code are passed around for debugging purposes, this occurs wholly independently of the thread struct values. These values were never part of the sigcontext ABI and are thus never passed anywhere, so we can just kill them off across the board.  Signed-off-by: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
f | probe.c | s | 2.2K | 68 | Paul Mundt | lethal@linux-sh.org | 1271818866 |  | sh: Tidy CPU probing and fixup section annotations.  This does a detect_cpu_and_cache_system() -> cpu_probe() rename, tidies up the unused return value, and stuffs it under __cpuinit in preparation for CPU hotplug.
