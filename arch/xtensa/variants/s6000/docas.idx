One for memory-memory transfers, the other three for memory-device.  This patch implements a platform-specific kernel-API to control these engines.  It is needed for the network, video, audio peripherals on s6000.

This is useful as the true frequency is set up by the boot loader, thus variable.  Signed-off-by: Oskar Schirmer <os@emlix.com> Signed-off-by: Chris Zankel <chris@zankel.net>
