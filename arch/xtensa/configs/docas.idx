Whoever wants to change the default spinlock inlining behavior and uninline the spinlocks for some weird reason, such as spinlock debugging, paravirt etc. can now all just select UNINLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK  Original discussion at: https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/21/357  Suggested-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org> Signed-off-by: Raghavendra K T <raghavendra.kt@linux.vnet.ibm.com> Cc: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org> Cc: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org> Cc: Chris Metcalf <cmetcalf@tilera.com> Cc: Chris Zankel <chris@zankel.net> Cc: linux-mips@linux-mips.org Link: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20120322095502.30866.75756.sendpatchset@codeblue [ tidied up the changelog a bit ] Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@kernel.org>
f | s6105_defconfig | g | 13K |  | John Stultz | john.stultz@linaro.org | 1317758867 |  | time: Cleanup old CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME references that snuck in  Awhile back I removed all the CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME referecnes as the last of the non-GENERIC_TIME arches were converted.  However, due to the functionality being important and around for awhile, there apparently were some out of tree hardware enablement patches that used it and have since been merged.  This patch removes the remaining instances of GENERIC_TIME.  Singed-off-by: John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>

It gets rid of:   - the net/tr.c which the drivers depended on   - the drivers/net component   - the Kbuild infrastructure around it   - any tokenring related CONFIG_ settings in any defconfigs   - the tokenring headers in the include/linux dir   - the firmware associated with the tokenring drivers.   - any associated token ring documentation.
