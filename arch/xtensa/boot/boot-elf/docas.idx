f | boot.lds.S | g | 927B |  | Chris Zankel | chris@zankel.net | 1225995909 |  | xtensa: move headers files to arch/xtensa/include  Move all header files for xtensa to arch/xtensa/include and platform and variant header files to the appropriate arch/xtensa/platforms/ and arch/xtensa/variants/ directories.  Moving the files gets also rid of all uses of symlinks in the Makefile.  This has been completed already for the majority of the architectures and xtensa is one out of six missing.

When building with binutils-2.18, vmlinux includes .note.gnu.build-id sections that need to be stripped out when building the binary image. The old .xt.insn sections haven't been used for a long time, so don't bother stripping them.  Signed-off-by: Bob Wilson <bob.wilson@acm.org> Signed-off-by: Chris Zankel <chris@zankel.net>

This rather lengthy patch removes all those files.  Unfortunately, there were many dependencies that needed to be updated, so this patch touches quite a few source files.
