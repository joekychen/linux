f | bootstrap.S | g | 4.7K |  | Chris Zankel | chris@zankel.net | 1225995909 |  | xtensa: move headers files to arch/xtensa/include  Move all header files for xtensa to arch/xtensa/include and platform and variant header files to the appropriate arch/xtensa/platforms/ and arch/xtensa/variants/ directories.  Moving the files gets also rid of all uses of symlinks in the Makefile.  This has been completed already for the majority of the architectures and xtensa is one out of six missing.

f | Makefile | g | 1014B |  | Bob Wilson | bwilson@heron.(none) | 1202953505 |  | [XTENSA] Fix makefile to work with binutils-2.18.  When building with binutils-2.18, vmlinux includes .note.gnu.build-id sections that need to be stripped out when building the binary image. The old .xt.insn sections haven't been used for a long time, so don't bother stripping them.  Signed-off-by: Bob Wilson <bob.wilson@acm.org> Signed-off-by: Chris Zankel <chris@zankel.net>
f | boot.ld | g | 812B |  | Marc Gauthier | marc@gums.hq.tensilica.com | 1202951734 |  | [XTENSA] adjust boot linker script start addresses  Move boot-redboot load address from 0xD0200000 to 0xD1000000 to make space for larger kernel images, in particular those with an embedded initramfs filesystem. Also properly set the ELF start address in boot-elf images so that PC need not be set manually when loading them using GDB.  Signed-off-by: Marc Gauthier <marc@tensilica.com>
