f | hardware.h | s | 621B | 23 | Chris Zankel | chris@zankel.net | 1225995909 |  | xtensa: move headers files to arch/xtensa/include  Move all header files for xtensa to arch/xtensa/include and platform and variant header files to the appropriate arch/xtensa/platforms/ and arch/xtensa/variants/ directories.  Moving the files gets also rid of all uses of symlinks in the Makefile.  This has been completed already for the majority of the architectures and xtensa is one out of six missing.
