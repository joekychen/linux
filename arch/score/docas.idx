d | kernel |  | 15 items |  | Al Viro | viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk | 1338569932 |  | new helper: signal_delivered()  Does block_sigmask() + tracehook_signal_handler();  called when sigframe has been successfully built.  All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

Outside x86 we have a small s390 and a very large ppc   update.    Regarding the new (for kvm) rebaseless workflow, some of the patches   that were merged before we switch trees had to be rebased, while   others are true pulls.  In either case the signoffs should be correct   now."  Fix up trivial conflicts in Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_segment.S and arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_para.h.  I suspect the kvm_para.h resolution ends up doing the "do I have cpuid" check effectively twice (it was done differently in two different commits), but better safe than sorry ;)  * 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm: (125 commits)   KVM: make asm-generic/kvm_para.h have an ifdef __KERNEL__ block   KVM: s390: onereg for timer related registers   KVM: s390: epoch difference and TOD programmable field   KVM: s390: KVM_GET/SET_ONEREG for s390   KVM: s390: add capability indicating COW support   KVM: Fix mmu_reload() clash with nested vmx event injection   KVM: MMU: Don't use RCU for lockless shadow walking   KVM: VMX: Optimize %ds, %es reload   KVM: VMX: Fix %ds/%es clobber   KVM: x86 emulator: convert bsf/bsr instructions to emulate_2op_SrcV_nobyte()   KVM: VMX: unlike vmcs on fail path   KVM: PPC: Emulator: clean up SPR reads and writes   KVM: PPC: Emulator: clean up instruction parsing   kvm/powerpc: Add new ioctl to retreive server MMU infos   kvm/book3s: Make kernel emulated H_PUT_TCE available for "PR" KVM   KVM: PPC: bookehv: Fix r8/r13 storing in level exception handler   KVM: PPC: Book3S: Enable IRQs during exit handling   KVM: PPC: Fix PR KVM on POWER7 bare metal   KVM: PPC: Fix stbux emulation   KVM: PPC: bookehv: Use lwz/stw instead of PPC_LL/PPC_STL for 32-bit fields   ...

f | Kconfig | g | 1.6K |  | Thomas Gleixner | tglx@linutronix.de | 1337636626 |  | timers: Fixup the Kconfig consolidation fallout  Sigh, I missed to check which architecture Kconfig files actually include the core Kconfig file. There are a few which did not. So we broke them.  Instead of adding the includes to those, we are better off to move the include to init/Kconfig like we did already with irqs and others.  This does not change anything for the architectures using the old style periodic timer mode. It just solves the build wreckage there.  For those architectures which use the clock events infrastructure it moves the include of the core Kconfig file to "General setup" which is a way more logical place than having it at random locations specified by the architecture specific Kconfigs.

d | configs |  | 1 items |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.
