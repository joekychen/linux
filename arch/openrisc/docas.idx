d | kernel |  | 20 items |  | Al Viro | viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk | 1338569932 |  | new helper: signal_delivered()  Does block_sigmask() + tracehook_signal_handler();  called when sigframe has been successfully built.  All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

The special Makefile treatment is pointless anyway as init_task.o contains only data which is handled by the linker script. So no point on being treated like head text.

d | boot |  | 2 items |  | Stephen Warren | swarren@nvidia.com | 1326582275 |  | Kbuild: Use dtc's -d (dependency) option  This hooks dtc into Kbuild's dependency system.  Thus, for example, "make dtbs" will rebuild tegra-harmony.dtb if only tegra20.dtsi has changed yet tegra-harmony.dts has not. The previous lack of this feature recently caused me to have very confusing "git bisect" results.  For ARM, it's obvious what to add to $(targets). I'm not familiar enough with other architectures to know what to add there. Powerpc appears to already add various .dtb files into $(targets), but the other archs may need something added to $(targets) to work.

These changes reduce the mmap_sem hold time, which is crucial during OOM killer invocation.  Port these changes to openrisc.  Signed-off-by: Mohd.
