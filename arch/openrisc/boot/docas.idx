f | Makefile | g | 279B |  | Stephen Warren | swarren@nvidia.com | 1326582275 |  | Kbuild: Use dtc's -d (dependency) option  This hooks dtc into Kbuild's dependency system.  Thus, for example, "make dtbs" will rebuild tegra-harmony.dtb if only tegra20.dtsi has changed yet tegra-harmony.dts has not. The previous lack of this feature recently caused me to have very confusing "git bisect" results.  For ARM, it's obvious what to add to $(targets). I'm not familiar enough with other architectures to know what to add there. Powerpc appears to already add various .dtb files into $(targets), but the other archs may need something added to $(targets) to work.

This is currently limited to having a device tree built into the kernel, but work is underway within the OpenRISC project to define how this device tree blob should be passed into the kernel from an external resource.  Patch contains a single example DTS file to go with the defconfig for or1ksim.
