This patch sets the bit at the time the node is initialized.  If N_NORMAL_MEMORY is not accurate, slub may encounter errors since it uses this nodemask to setup per-cache kmem_cache_node data structures.

f | extable.c | s | 2.3K | 81 | Rusty Russell | rusty@rustcorp.com.au | 1244809024 |  | module: trim exception table on init free.  It's theoretically possible that there are exception table entries which point into the (freed) init text of modules.  These could cause future problems if other modules get loaded into that memory and cause an exception as we'd see the wrong fixup.  The only case I know of is kvm-intel.ko (when CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=n).  Amerigo fixed this long-standing FIXME in the x86 version, but this patch is more general.  This implements trim_init_extable(); most archs are simple since they use the standard lib/extable.c sort code.  Alpha and IA64 use relative addresses in their fixups, so thier trimming is a slight variation.  Sparc32 is unique; it doesn't seem to define ARCH_HAS_SORT_EXTABLE, yet it defines its own sort_extable() which overrides the one in lib. It doesn't sort, so we have to mark deleted entries instead of actually trimming them.
