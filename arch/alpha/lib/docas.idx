As a result of wrong register use (which was my fault back in 2003, IIRC), under some circumstances extra terminating zero bytes were added to destination string.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

f | ev6-csum_ipv6_magic.S | g | 5.1K |  | Ivan Kokshaysky | ink@jurassic.park.msu.ru | 1182700751 |  | alpha: fix alignment problem in csum_ipv6_magic()  Hopefully this fixes http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8635  The struct in6_addr passed to csum_ipv6_magic() is 4 byte aligned, so we can't use the regular 64-bit loads.  Since the cost of handling of 4 byte and 1 byte aligned 64-bit data is roughly the same, this code can cope with any src/dst [mis]alignment.
