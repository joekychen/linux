f | sfp-util.h | s | 969B | 28 | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1274887815 |  | Revert "endian: #define __BYTE_ORDER"  This reverts commit b3b77c8caef1750ebeea1054e39e358550ea9f55, which was also totally broken (see commit 0d2daf5cc858 that reverted the crc32 version of it).  As reported by Stephen Rothwell, it causes problems on big-endian machines:  > In file included from fs/jfs/jfs_types.h:33, >                  from fs/jfs/jfs_incore.h:26, >                  from fs/jfs/file.c:22: > fs/jfs/endian24.h:36:101: warning: "__LITTLE_ENDIAN" is not defined  The kernel has never had that crazy "__BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN" model.  It's not how we do things, and it isn't how we _should_ do things.  So don't go there.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
