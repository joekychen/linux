So, this causes problems on architectures where the icache doesn't fill from the dcache or with dcache aliases.  The patch fixes this.  The ARCH_IMPLEMENTS_FLUSH_DCACHE_PAGE symbol was introduced to avoid pointless empty cache-thrashing loops on architectures for which flush_dcache_page() is a no-op.  Every architecture was provided with this flush pages on architectires where ARCH_IMPLEMENTS_FLUSH_DCACHE_PAGE is equal 1 or do nothing otherwise.

We also cannot do it inside of asm/types.h because some headers need the word size but cannot include types.h.  The solution is to introduce a new header <asm/bitsperlong.h> that defines both __BITS_PER_LONG for user space and BITS_PER_LONG for usage in the kernel.

So it hasn't been so useful for drivers.  We have only one user of the API in tree.  Unlikely out-of-tree drivers use the API.  Even if we fix dma_is_consistent() in some architectures, it doesn't look useful at all.  It was invented long ago for some old systems that can't allocate coherent memory at all.  It's better to export only APIs that are definitely necessary for drivers.  Let's remove this API.

f | termbits.h | s | 4.6K | 185 | hyc@symas.com | hyc@symas.com | 1281473259 |  | tty: Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE  This patch is against the 2.6.34 source.  Paraphrased from the 1989 BSD patch by David Borman @ cray.com:       These are the changes needed for the kernel to support      LINEMODE in the server.       There is a new bit in the termios local flag word, EXTPROC.      When this bit is set, several aspects of the terminal driver      are disabled.  Input line editing, character echo, and mapping      of signals are all disabled.  This allows the telnetd to turn      off these functions when in linemode, but still keep track of      what state the user wants the terminal to be in.       New ioctl:          TIOCSIG         Generate a signal to processes in the                          current process group of the pty.       There is a new mode for packet driver, the TIOCPKT_IOCTL bit.      When packet mode is turned on in the pty, and the EXTPROC bit      is set, then whenever the state of the pty is changed, the      next read on the master side of the pty will have the TIOCPKT_IOCTL      bit set.  This allows the process on the server side of the pty      to know when the state of the terminal has changed; it can then      issue the appropriate ioctl to retrieve the new state.  Since the original BSD patches accompanied the source code for telnet I've left that reference here, but obviously the feature is useful for any remote terminal protocol, including ssh.  The corresponding feature has existed in the BSD tty driver since 1989.

Architectures define it as ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN (it's used to make sure that malloc'ed buffer is DMA-safe; the buffer doesn't share a cache with the others).  So we can unify dma_get_cache_alignment implementations.  This patch:  dma_get_cache_alignment() needs to know if an architecture defines ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN or not (needs to know if architecture has DMA alignment restriction).  However, slab.h define ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN if architectures doesn't define it.  Let's rename ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN to ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN. ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is used only in the internals of slab/slob/slub (except for crypto).

They were mostly limited   to 386-sx 16MHz CPU and some 486 class machines and never more than   64MB of RAM.  Even the enthusiast hobbyist community seems to have   dried up close to ten years ago, based on what you can find searching   various websites dedicated to the relatively short lived hardware.    So lets remove the support relating to CONFIG_MCA.  There is no point   carrying this forward, wasting cycles doing routine maintenance on it;   wasting allyesconfig build time on validating it, wasting I/O on git   grep'ping over it, and so on."  Let's see if anybody screams.  It generally has compiled, and James Bottomley pointed out that there was a MCA extension from NCR that allowed for up to 4GB of memory and PPro-class machines.  So in *theory* there may be users out there.  But even James (technically listed as a maintainer) doesn't actually have a system, and while Alan Cox claims to have a machine in his cellar that he offered to anybody who wants to take it off his hands, he didn't argue for keeping MCA support either.  So we could bring it back.  But somebody had better speak up and talk about how they have actually been using said MCA hardware with modern kernels for us to do that.  And David already took the patch to delete all the networking driver code (commit a5e371f61ad3: "drivers/net: delete all code/drivers depending on CONFIG_MCA").  * 'delete-mca' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulg/linux:   MCA: delete all remaining traces of microchannel bus support.   scsi: delete the MCA specific drivers and driver code   serial: delete the MCA specific 8250 support.   arm: remove ability to select CONFIG_MCA

The NOMMU code path always passes PROT_EXEC to the mmap() call.  While this doesn't matter to most people whilst the code is running, it will cause a pointless icache flush when starting every FDPIC application.  Typically this icache flush will be of a region on the order of 128KB in size, or may be the entire icache, depending on the facilities available on the CPU.  In the case where the arch default behaviour seems to be desired (EXSTACK_DEFAULT), we probe VM_STACK_FLAGS for VM_EXEC to determine whether we should be setting PROT_EXEC or not.  For arches that support an MPU (Memory Protection Unit - an MMU without the virtual mapping capability), setting PROT_EXEC or not will make an important difference.  It should be noted that this change also affects the executability of the brk region, since ELF-FDPIC has that share with the stack.  However, this is probably irrelevant as NOMMU programs aren't likely to use the brk region, preferring instead allocation via mmap().

Basically, the TLB can be loaded with "large" pages that cover the whole virtual space (well, sort-of, half of it actually) represented by a PTE page, and which contain an "indirect" bit indicating that this TLB entry RPN points to an array of PTEs from which the TLB can then create direct entries. Thus, in order to invalidate those when PTE pages are deleted, we need the virtual address to pass to tlbilx or tlbivax instructions.  The old trick of sticking it somewhere in the PTE page struct page sucks too much, the address is almost readily available in all call sites and almost everybody implemets these as macros, so we may as well add the argument everywhere.

This causes tests of the following sort:  	/* don't pin down non-user-based iovecs */ 	if (segment_eq(get_fs(), KERNEL_DS)) 		return NULL;  to malfunction.  To fix this, make USER_DS the top of RAM instead of the top of the non-IO address space, and make KERNEL_DS one more than the top of the non-IO address space.  Also get rid of FRV's __addr_ok() as nothing uses it.
