d | lib |  | 17 items |  | Peter Zijlstra | a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl | 1287424730 |  | irq_work: Add generic hardirq context callbacks  Provide a mechanism that allows running code in IRQ context. It is most useful for NMI code that needs to interact with the rest of the system -- like wakeup a task to drain buffers.  Perf currently has such a mechanism, so extract that and provide it as a generic feature, independent of perf so that others may also benefit.  The IRQ context callback is generated through self-IPIs where possible, or on architectures like powerpc the decrementer (the built-in timer facility) is set to generate an interrupt immediately.  Architectures that don't have anything like this get to do with a callback from the timer tick. These architectures can call irq_work_run() at the tail of any IRQ handlers that might enqueue such work (like the perf IRQ handler) to avoid undue latencies in processing the work.

There's also a gdbstub available.   (*) DEBUG_PAGEALLOC  	This can't be easily be done since we use huge static mappings to 	cover the kernel, not pages.

f | defconfig | g | 930B |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.
