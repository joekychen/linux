f | install.sh | s | 1.3K | 50 | Sam Ravnborg | sam@ravnborg.org | 1253441894 |  | kbuild: use INSTALLKERNEL to select customized installkernel script  Replace the use of CROSS_COMPILE to select a customized installkernel script with the possibility to set INSTALLKERNEL to select a custom installkernel script when running make:      make INSTALLKERNEL=arm-installkernel install  With this patch we are now more consistent across different architectures - they did not all support use of CROSS_COMPILE.  The use of CROSS_COMPILE was a hack as this really belongs to gcc/binutils and the installkernel script does not change just because we change toolchain.  The use of CROSS_COMPILE caused troubles with an upcoming patch that saves CROSS_COMPILE when a kernel is built - it would no longer be installable. [Thanks to Peter Z. for this hint]  This patch undos what Ian did in commit:    0f8e2d62fa04441cd12c08ce521e84e5bd3f8a46   ("use ${CROSS_COMPILE}installkernel in arch/*/boot/install.sh")  The patch has been lightly tested on x86 only - but all changes looks obvious.
