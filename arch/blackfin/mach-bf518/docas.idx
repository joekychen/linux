It also removes:  - verbose GPL text(refer to the top level ./COPYING file)  - file names (you are looking at the file)  - bug url (it's in the ./MAINTAINERS file)  - "or later" on GPL-2, when we did not have that right  It also allows some Blackfin-specific assembly files to be under a BSD like license (for people to use them outside of Linux).

So drop the old options as they were never used (and were simply wrong), and add the BF51x specific pieces to the Kconfig and header.  Signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
