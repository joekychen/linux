In order to verify these aren't a problem (and won't be in the future), extend the self tests to operate on as much L1 SRAM as possible.  Signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
f | Makefile | g | 87B |  | Jason Wessel | jason.wessel@windriver.com | 1262887116 |  | blackfin,kgdb,probe_kernel: Cleanup probe_kernel_read/write  Blackfin needs it own arch specific probe_kernel_read() and probe_kernel_write().  This was moved out of the kgdb code and into the arch/blackfin/maccess.c, because it is a generic kernel api.  The arch specific kgdb.c for blackfin was cleaned of all functions which exist in the kgdb core that do the same thing after resolving the probe_kernel_read() and probe_kernel_write().  This also eliminated the need for most of the #include's.

It also removes:  - verbose GPL text(refer to the top level ./COPYING file)  - file names (you are looking at the file)  - bug url (it's in the ./MAINTAINERS file)  - "or later" on GPL-2, when we did not have that right  It also allows some Blackfin-specific assembly files to be under a BSD like license (for people to use them outside of Linux).
