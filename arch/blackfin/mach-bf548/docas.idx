It also removes:  - verbose GPL text(refer to the top level ./COPYING file)  - file names (you are looking at the file)  - bug url (it's in the ./MAINTAINERS file)  - "or later" on GPL-2, when we did not have that right  It also allows some Blackfin-specific assembly files to be under a BSD like license (for people to use them outside of Linux).

So add a kconfig option so people can select which channels the UARTs will use so they can pick between SPORTs and the less commonly used EPPI/PIXC peripherals.
