f | cdefBF548.h | s | 48K | 743 | Mike Frysinger | vapier@gentoo.org | 1294661888 |  | Blackfin: clean up mach header includes  The main asm/blackfin.h header will pull in mach/blackfin.h to get all the fun Blackfin defines.  So having any of the sub-mach headers trying to include asm/blackfin.h makes no sense -- punt it.  The mach/blackfin.h header takes care of including the part-specific def headers which in turn will include any other needed def file. Similarly, it takes care of pulling in the part-specific cdef header. So move this logic out of the blackfin.h when necessary.  Further, make sure the cdef headers do not waste time including the def headers again.  Since all parts need the common def/cdef headers, move this logic out of the part-specific headers and into the mach/blackfin.h file.  Finally, we need to split the BF539 def header since the BF538 does not have MXVR and we don't want to expose those MMRs.  So now all parts should have the same behavior: 	mach/blackfin.h 		asm/def_LPBlackfin.h 		part-specific def.h 		if ! asm 			asm/cdef_LPBlackfin.h 			part-specific cdef.h And the sub def/cdef headers only tail into what they need.
