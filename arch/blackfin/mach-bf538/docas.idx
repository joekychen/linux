It also removes:  - verbose GPL text(refer to the top level ./COPYING file)  - file names (you are looking at the file)  - bug url (it's in the ./MAINTAINERS file)  - "or later" on GPL-2, when we did not have that right  It also allows some Blackfin-specific assembly files to be under a BSD like license (for people to use them outside of Linux).

f | Makefile | g | 108B |  | Michael Hennerich | michael.hennerich@analog.com | 1260854045 |  | Blackfin: bf538: add support for extended GPIO banks  The GPIOs on ports C/D/E on the BF538/BF539 do not behave the same way as the other ports on the part and the same way as all other Blackfin parts. The MMRs are programmed slightly different and they cannot be used to generate interrupts or wakeup a sleeping system.  Since these guys don't fit into the existing code, create a simple gpiolib driver for them.
