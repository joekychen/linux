But this currently breaks SMP support as the L1 inst sram is per-core and cannot be called directly.  So in preparation for making that work, split the two options.  Further, split out the SMP depend so that we can allow some for SMP.  Signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

It also removes:  - verbose GPL text(refer to the top level ./COPYING file)  - file names (you are looking at the file)  - bug url (it's in the ./MAINTAINERS file)  - "or later" on GPL-2, when we did not have that right  It also allows some Blackfin-specific assembly files to be under a BSD like license (for people to use them outside of Linux).

The trouble with multi-core systems is that all L1 sram is visible only to the active core.  So we can't just place the functions into L1 and call it directly.  We need to setup a jump table and place the entry point in external memory.  This will call the right func based on the active core.  In the process, convert from the manual relocation of a small bit of code into Core B's L1 to the more general framework we already have in place for loading arbitrary pieces of code into L1.
