It also combines the gpio port H mask B and the emac tx interrupts, and the watchdog and port F mask B interrupts, but since we don't support mask B yet, just add the defines for now.

f | Kconfig | g | 2.0K |  | Michael Hennerich | michael.hennerich@analog.com | 1287733729 |  | Blackfin: SIC: BF537: change default data/error relative priorities  Some peripherals might generate an error interrupt shortly after the data interrupt due to the fact that the peripheral isn't serviced fast enough.  In most cases this isn't a problem and is expected behavior. This hasn't been a problem on most parts since you simply don't request the error interrupt (or you leave it disabled while there is an expected state) and do the peripheral status checking in the data interrupt.  The Blackfin SIC allows people to prioritize data and error interrupts, and the Blackfin CEC allows interrupts of equal or higher priority to nest.  The current default settings gives error interrupts a higher priority than data interrupts.  So if an error occurs while processing the data interrupt, it will be serviced immediately.  However, the error interrupt on the BF537 SIC cannot be enabled on a per-peripheral basis.  Once the error interrupt is enabled for one peripheral, it is automatically enabled for all peripherals.  Therefore lower the default multiplexed error interrupt priority so most people need not worry themselves with this issue.
