f | Kconfig | g | 7.7K |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1337962739 |  | Merge branch 'for-linus' of git://git.linaro.org/people/mszyprowski/linux-dma-mapping  Pull CMA and ARM DMA-mapping updates from Marek Szyprowski:  "These patches contain two major updates for DMA mapping subsystem   (mainly for ARM architecture).  First one is Contiguous Memory   Allocator (CMA) which makes it possible for device drivers to allocate   big contiguous chunks of memory after the system has booted.    The main difference from the similar frameworks is the fact that CMA   allows to transparently reuse the memory region reserved for the big   chunk allocation as a system memory, so no memory is wasted when no   big chunk is allocated.  Once the alloc request is issued, the   framework migrates system pages to create space for the required big   chunk of physically contiguous memory.    For more information one can refer to nice LWN articles:     - 'A reworked contiguous memory allocator': 		http://lwn.net/Articles/447405/     - 'CMA and ARM': 		http://lwn.net/Articles/450286/     - 'A deep dive into CMA': 		http://lwn.net/Articles/486301/     - and the following thread with the patches and links to all previous      versions: 		https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/3/204    The main client for this new framework is ARM DMA-mapping subsystem.    The second part provides a complete redesign in ARM DMA-mapping   subsystem.  The core implementation has been changed to use common   struct dma_map_ops based infrastructure with the recent updates for   new dma attributes merged in v3.4-rc2.  This allows to use more than   one implementation of dma-mapping calls and change/select them on the   struct device basis.  The first client of this new infractructure is   dmabounce implementation which has been completely cut out of the   core, common code.    The last patch of this redesign update introduces a new, experimental   implementation of dma-mapping calls on top of generic IOMMU framework.   This lets ARM sub-platform to transparently use IOMMU for DMA-mapping   calls if one provides required IOMMU hardware.    For more information please refer to the following thread: 		http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg175729.html    The last patch merges changes from both updates and provides a   resolution for the conflicts which cannot be avoided when patches have   been applied on the same files (mainly arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c)."
