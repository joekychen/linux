f | a500_defconfig | g | 4.4K |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.
