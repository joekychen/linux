f | fixup.S | g | 2.3K |  | Rusty Russell | rusty@rustcorp.com.au | 1256823255 |  | percpu: remove per_cpu__ prefix.  Now that the return from alloc_percpu is compatible with the address of per-cpu vars, it makes sense to hand around the address of per-cpu variables.  To make this sane, we remove the per_cpu__ prefix we used created to stop people accidentally using these vars directly.  Now we have sparse, we can use that (next patch).  tj: * Updated to convert stuff which were missed by or added after the       original patch.      * Kill per_cpu_var() macro.

We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
