Spark and OpenRisc were fixed to use this, but not parisc.  Fix by adding to generic-y in asm/Kbuild  Signed-off-by: James Bottomley <JBottomley@Parallels.com>
d | kernel |  | 46 items |  | Al Viro | viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk | 1338569932 |  | new helper: signal_delivered()  Does block_sigmask() + tracehook_signal_handler();  called when sigframe has been successfully built.  All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

f | install.sh | s | 935B | 32 | Sam Ravnborg | sam@ravnborg.org | 1253441894 |  | kbuild: use INSTALLKERNEL to select customized installkernel script  Replace the use of CROSS_COMPILE to select a customized installkernel script with the possibility to set INSTALLKERNEL to select a custom installkernel script when running make:      make INSTALLKERNEL=arm-installkernel install  With this patch we are now more consistent across different architectures - they did not all support use of CROSS_COMPILE.  The use of CROSS_COMPILE was a hack as this really belongs to gcc/binutils and the installkernel script does not change just because we change toolchain.  The use of CROSS_COMPILE caused troubles with an upcoming patch that saves CROSS_COMPILE when a kernel is built - it would no longer be installable. [Thanks to Peter Z. for this hint]  This patch undos what Ian did in commit:    0f8e2d62fa04441cd12c08ce521e84e5bd3f8a46   ("use ${CROSS_COMPILE}installkernel in arch/*/boot/install.sh")  The patch has been lightly tested on x86 only - but all changes looks obvious.

d | configs |  | 5 items |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.
