f | termbits.h | s | 4.5K | 182 | hyc@symas.com | hyc@symas.com | 1281473259 |  | tty: Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE  This patch is against the 2.6.34 source.  Paraphrased from the 1989 BSD patch by David Borman @ cray.com:       These are the changes needed for the kernel to support      LINEMODE in the server.       There is a new bit in the termios local flag word, EXTPROC.      When this bit is set, several aspects of the terminal driver      are disabled.  Input line editing, character echo, and mapping      of signals are all disabled.  This allows the telnetd to turn      off these functions when in linemode, but still keep track of      what state the user wants the terminal to be in.       New ioctl:          TIOCSIG         Generate a signal to processes in the                          current process group of the pty.       There is a new mode for packet driver, the TIOCPKT_IOCTL bit.      When packet mode is turned on in the pty, and the EXTPROC bit      is set, then whenever the state of the pty is changed, the      next read on the master side of the pty will have the TIOCPKT_IOCTL      bit set.  This allows the process on the server side of the pty      to know when the state of the terminal has changed; it can then      issue the appropriate ioctl to retrieve the new state.  Since the original BSD patches accompanied the source code for telnet I've left that reference here, but obviously the feature is useful for any remote terminal protocol, including ssh.  The corresponding feature has existed in the BSD tty driver since 1989.

The rest I have looked at closely and I can't find any problems.  setns is an easy system call to wire up.  It just takes two ints so I don't expect any weird architecture porting problems.  While doing this I have noticed that we have some architectures that are very slow to get new system calls.  cris seems to be the slowest where the last system calls wired up were preadv and pwritev.  avr32 is weird in that recvmmsg was wired up but never declared in unistd.h.  frv is behind with perf_event_open being the last syscall wired up.  On h8300 the last system call wired up was epoll_wait.  On m32r the last system call wired up was fallocate.  mn10300 has recvmmsg as the last system call wired up.  The rest seem to at least have syncfs wired up which was new in the 2.6.39.  v2: Most of the architecture support added by Daniel Lezcano <dlezcano@fr.ibm.com> v3: ported to v2.6.36-rc4 by: Eric W.

f | irqflags.h | s | 1.4K | 50 | David Howells | dhowells@redhat.com | 1286456935 |  | Fix IRQ flag handling naming  Fix the IRQ flag handling naming.  In linux/irqflags.h under one configuration, it maps:  	local_irq_enable() -> raw_local_irq_enable() 	local_irq_disable() -> raw_local_irq_disable() 	local_irq_save() -> raw_local_irq_save() 	...  and under the other configuration, it maps:  	raw_local_irq_enable() -> local_irq_enable() 	raw_local_irq_disable() -> local_irq_disable() 	raw_local_irq_save() -> local_irq_save() 	...  This is quite confusing.  There should be one set of names expected of the arch, and this should be wrapped to give another set of names that are expected by users of this facility.  Change this to have the arch provide:  	flags = arch_local_save_flags() 	flags = arch_local_irq_save() 	arch_local_irq_restore(flags) 	arch_local_irq_disable() 	arch_local_irq_enable() 	arch_irqs_disabled_flags(flags) 	arch_irqs_disabled() 	arch_safe_halt()  Then linux/irqflags.h wraps these to provide:  	raw_local_save_flags(flags) 	raw_local_irq_save(flags) 	raw_local_irq_restore(flags) 	raw_local_irq_disable() 	raw_local_irq_enable() 	raw_irqs_disabled_flags(flags) 	raw_irqs_disabled() 	raw_safe_halt()  with type checking on the flags 'arguments', and then wraps those to provide:  	local_save_flags(flags) 	local_irq_save(flags) 	local_irq_restore(flags) 	local_irq_disable() 	local_irq_enable() 	irqs_disabled_flags(flags) 	irqs_disabled() 	safe_halt()  with tracing included if enabled.  The arch functions can now all be inline functions rather than some of them having to be macros.

The problem here is that we don't have a "call"-ish pseudo-instruction to use instead of rjmp...we could add one, but that means we'll have to wait for a new toolchain release, wait until we're fairly sure most people are using it, etc...  As an added bonus, it should decrease the RAM footprint slightly, though it might pollute the icache a bit more.  Signed-off-by: Haavard Skinnemoen <haavard.skinnemoen@atmel.com>
