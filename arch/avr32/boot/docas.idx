Move it to Makefile.lib to avoid duplication.  All ARCHs have similar definitions of cmd_uimage. Place a sufficiently parameterized version in Makefile.lib to avoid duplication.

d | u-boot |  | 3 items |  | Haavard Skinnemoen | hskinnemoen@atmel.com | 1159285734 |  | [PATCH] avr32 architecture  This adds support for the Atmel AVR32 architecture as well as the AT32AP7000 CPU and the AT32STK1000 development board.  AVR32 is a new high-performance 32-bit RISC microprocessor core, designed for cost-sensitive embedded applications, with particular emphasis on low power consumption and high code density.  The AVR32 architecture is not binary compatible with earlier 8-bit AVR architectures.  The AVR32 architecture, including the instruction set, is described by the AVR32 Architecture Manual, available from  http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc32000.pdf  The Atmel AT32AP7000 is the first CPU implementing the AVR32 architecture.  It features a 7-stage pipeline, 16KB instruction and data caches and a full Memory Management Unit.  It also comes with a large set of integrated peripherals, many of which are shared with the AT91 ARM-based controllers from Atmel.  Full data sheet is available from  http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc32003.pdf  while the CPU core implementation including caches and MMU is documented by the AVR32 AP Technical Reference, available from  http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc32001.pdf  Information about the AT32STK1000 development board can be found at  http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3918  including a BSP CD image with an earlier version of this patch, development tools (binaries and source/patches) and a root filesystem image suitable for booting from SD card.  Alternatively, there's a preliminary "getting started" guide available at http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/GettingStarted which provides links to the sources and patches you will need in order to set up a cross-compiling environment for avr32-linux.  This patch, as well as the other patches included with the BSP and the toolchain patches, is actively supported by Atmel Corporation.
