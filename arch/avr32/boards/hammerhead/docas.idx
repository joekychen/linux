Create a common macb_platform_data for macb that both at91 and avr32 can use.  In future we can use this to support other architectures that use the same IP block with the macb driver.  v2: rename eth_platform_data to macb_platform_data and allow at91_ether to share the platform data with macb.

It offers versatile peripherals, such as ethernet, usb device, usb host etc.  The board also incooperates a power supply and is a Power over Ethernet (PoE) Powered Device (PD).  Additonally, a Cyclone III FPGA from Altera is integrated on the board. The FPGA is mapped into the 32-bit AVR memory bus. The FPGA offers two DDR2 SDRAM interfaces, which will cover even the most exceptional need of memory bandwidth. Together with the onboard video decoder the board is ready for video processing.  This patch does include the basic support for the fpga device driver, but not the device driver itself.
