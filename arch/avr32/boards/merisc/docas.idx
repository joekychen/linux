f | setup.c | s | 6.7K | 252 | Jamie Iles | jamie@jamieiles.com | 1321975276 |  | macb: unify at91 and avr32 platform data  Both at91 and avr32 defines its own platform data structure for the macb driver and both share common structures though at91 includes a currently unused phy_irq_pin.  Create a common macb_platform_data for macb that both at91 and avr32 can use.  In future we can use this to support other architectures that use the same IP block with the macb driver.  v2: rename eth_platform_data to macb_platform_data and allow at91_ether to share the platform data with macb.

The sysdev.h file should not be needed by any in-kernel code, so remove the .h file from these random files that seem to still want to include it.  The sysdev code will be going away soon, so this include needs to be removed no matter what.
