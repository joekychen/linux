On top of that several people over time has asked for a way to pass in additional flags to gcc.  This patch replace use of AFLAGS with KBUILD_AFLAGS all over the tree.  Patch was tested on following architectures: alpha, arm, i386, x86_64, mips, sparc, sparc64, ia64, m68k, s390  Signed-off-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

f | Kconfig.cpu | g | 3.0K |  | Thomas Gleixner | tglx@linutronix.de | 1337636626 |  | timers: Fixup the Kconfig consolidation fallout  Sigh, I missed to check which architecture Kconfig files actually include the core Kconfig file. There are a few which did not. So we broke them.  Instead of adding the includes to those, we are better off to move the include to init/Kconfig like we did already with irqs and others.  This does not change anything for the architectures using the old style periodic timer mode. It just solves the build wreckage there.  For those architectures which use the clock events infrastructure it moves the include of the core Kconfig file to "General setup" which is a way more logical place than having it at random locations specified by the architecture specific Kconfigs.

f | defconfig | g | 1.1K |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.

d | platform |  | 2 items |  | Mark Brown | broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com | 1319663728 |  | h8300: Move gpio.h to gpio-internal.h  The current h8300 GPIO implementation doesn't provide the standard GPIO API, and in fact provides only direction control rather than normal GPIO functionality. Currently this is only used by the platform interrupt implementation rather than by a range of drivers so in preparation for moving over to gpiolib move the header out of the way of the gpiolib header, allowing a default GPIO implementation to be provided.  For actual use of these GPIOs with gpiolib a real driver would still need to be written but there appears to be no current need for this.
