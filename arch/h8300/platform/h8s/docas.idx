f | irq.c | s | 3.1K | 95 | Mark Brown | broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com | 1319663728 |  | h8300: Move gpio.h to gpio-internal.h  The current h8300 GPIO implementation doesn't provide the standard GPIO API, and in fact provides only direction control rather than normal GPIO functionality. Currently this is only used by the platform interrupt implementation rather than by a range of drivers so in preparation for moving over to gpiolib move the header out of the way of the gpiolib header, allowing a default GPIO implementation to be provided.  For actual use of these GPIOs with gpiolib a real driver would still need to be written but there appears to be no current need for this.

f | ptrace_h8s.c | s | 2.2K | 75 | Christoph Hellwig | hch@lst.de | 1268437958 |  | h8300: use generic ptrace_resume code  Use the generic ptrace_resume code for PTRACE_SYSCALL, PTRACE_CONT, PTRACE_KILL and PTRACE_SINGLESTEP.  This implies defining arch_has_single_step in <asm/ptrace.h> and implementing the user_enable_single_step and user_disable_single_step functions, which also causes the breakpoint information to be cleared on fork, which could be considered a bug fix.  Also the TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE thread flag is now cleared on PTRACE_KILL which it previously wasn't which is consistent with all architectures using the modern ptrace code.
