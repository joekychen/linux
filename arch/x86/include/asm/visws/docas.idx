f | cobalt.h | s | 3.5K | 95 | Thomas Gleixner | tglx@linutronix.de | 1266624749 |  | x86: Move pci init function to x86_init  The PCI initialization in pci_subsys_init() is a mess. pci_numaq_init, pci_acpi_init, pci_visws_init and pci_legacy_init are called and each implementation checks and eventually modifies the global variable pcibios_scanned.  x86_init functions allow us to do this more elegant. The pci.init function pointer is preset to pci_legacy_init. numaq, acpi and visws can modify the pointer in their early setup functions. The functions return 0 when they did the full initialization including bus scan. A non zero return value indicates that pci_legacy_init needs to be called either because the selected function failed or wants the generic bus scan in pci_legacy_init to happen (e.g. visws).
