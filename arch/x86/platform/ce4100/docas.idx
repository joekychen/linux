f | falconfalls.dts | g | 8.9K |  | Sebastian Andrzej Siewior | bigeasy@linutronix.de | 1328310805 |  | gpio: Add a driver for Sodaville GPIO controller  Sodaville has GPIO controller behind the PCI bus. To my suprissed it is not the same as on PXA.  The interrupt & gpio chip can be referenced from the device tree like from any other driver. Unfortunately the driver which uses the gpio interrupt has to use irq_of_parse_and_map() instead of platform_get_irq(). The problem is that the platform device (which is created from the device tree) is most likely created before the interrupt chip is registered and therefore irq_of_parse_and_map() fails.  In theory the driver works as module. In reality most of the irq functions are not exported to modules and it is possible that _this_ module is unloaded while the provided irqs are still in use.
