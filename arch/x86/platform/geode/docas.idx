Fix up trivial conflicts: geode Geos update happening next to net5501 support, and MSIC thermal platform support added twice.  * 'for_linus' of git://cavan.codon.org.uk/platform-drivers-x86: (77 commits)   acer-wmi: add quirk table for video backlight vendor mode   drivers/platform/x86/amilo-rfkill.c::amilo_rfkill_probe() avoid NULL deref   samsung-laptop: unregister ACPI video module for some well known laptops   acer-wmi: No wifi rfkill on Sony machines   thinkpad-acpi: recognize Lenovo as version string in newer V-series BIOS   asus-wmi: don't update power and brightness when using scalar   eeepc-wmi: split et2012 specific hacks   eeepc-wmi: refine quirks handling   asus-nb-wmi: set panel_power correctly   asus-wmi: move WAPF variable into quirks_entry   asus-wmi: store backlight power status for AIO machine   asus-wmi: add scalar board brightness adj. support   samsung-laptop: cleanup return type: mode_t vs umode_t   drivers, samsung-laptop: fix usage of isalnum   drivers, samsung-laptop: fix initialization of sabi_data in sabi_set_commandb   asus-wmi: on/off bit is not set when reading the value   eeepc-wmi: add extra keymaps for EP121   asus-nb-wmi: ignore useless keys   acer-wmi: support Lenovo ideapad S205 Brazos wifi switch   acer-wmi: fix out of input parameter size when set   ...
f | net5501.c | s | 3.4K | 128 | Bjarke Istrup Pedersen | gurligebis@gentoo.org | 1336167607 |  | arch/x86/platform/geode/net5501.c: change active_low to 0 for LED driver  It seems that there was an error with the active_low = 1 for the LED, since it should be set to 0 (meaning that active is high, since 0 is false, hence the confusion.  The wiki article about it confuses it, since it contradicts itself, regarding what turns on the LED.  I have tested 3.4-rc2 on my net5501 with this patch, and it makes the LED behave correctly, where "none" turns it off, and "default-on" turns it on, when echoed onto the trigger "file" in /sys/class/leds.

Trivial platform driver for Traverse Technologies Geos and Geos2 single-board computers. Uses SMBIOS to identify platform. Based on progressive revisions of the leds-net5501 driver that was rewritten by Ed Wildgoose as a platform driver.  Supports GPIO-based LEDs (3) and 1 polled button which is typically used for a soft reset.
