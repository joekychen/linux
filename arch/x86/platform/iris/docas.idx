f | iris.c | s | 2.8K | 80 | Rusty Russell | rusty@rustcorp.com.au | 1326409338 |  | module_param: make bool parameters really bool (arch)  module_param(bool) used to counter-intuitively take an int.  In fddd5201 (mid-2009) we allowed bool or int/unsigned int using a messy trick.  It's time to remove the int/unsigned int option.  For this version it'll simply give a warning, but it'll break next kernel version.  Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
