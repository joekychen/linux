d | kernel |  | 17 items |  | Al Viro | viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk | 1338569932 |  | new helper: signal_delivered()  Does block_sigmask() + tracehook_signal_handler();  called when sigframe has been successfully built.  All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

f | output_arch.ld | g | 87B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
d | lib |  | 11 items |  | Paul Gortmaker | paul.gortmaker@windriver.com | 1334827024 |  | cris: Remove old legacy "-traditional" flag from arch-v10/lib/Makefile  Most of these have been purged years ago.  This one silently lived on until commit 69349c2dc01c489eccaa4c472542c08e370c6d7e      "kconfig: fix IS_ENABLED to not require all options to be defined"  In the above, we use some macro trickery to create a conditional that is valid in CPP and in C usage.  However that trickery doesn't sit well if you have the legacy "-traditional" flag enabled.  You'll get:    AS      arch/cris/arch-v10/lib/checksum.o In file included from <command-line>:4:0: include/linux/kconfig.h:23:0: error: syntax error in macro parameter list make[2]: *** [arch/cris/arch-v10/lib/checksum.o] Error 1  Everything builds fine w/o "-traditional" so simply drop it from this location as well.
