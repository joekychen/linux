The sun4c support has been know broken for quite some time too.  So rather than trying to keep it up-to-date, lets get rid of it. This allows us to do some very welcome cleanup of sparc32 support.  Updated the former sun4c specifc nmi (which was also used for sun4m UP) to be a generic UP NMI.  Signed-off-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

f | Kconfig.debug | g | 335B |  | Stephen Boyd | sboyd@codeaurora.org | 1306337994 |  | lib: consolidate DEBUG_STACK_USAGE option  Most arches define CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE exactly the same way.  Move it to lib/Kconfig.debug so each arch doesn't have to define it.  This obviously makes the option generic, but that's fine because the config is already used in generic code.  It's not obvious to me that sysrq-P actually does anything caution by keeping the most inclusive wording.

And as a result we were able to also kill off that ugly btfixup thing    that required multi-stage links of the final vmlinux image in the    Kbuild system.  This should make the kbuild maintainers really happy.     Thanks a lot to Sam Ravnborg for his tireless efforts to get this    going.  2) Convert sparc64 to nobootmem.  I suspect now with sparc32 being a lot    cleaner, it should be able to fall in line and modernize in this area    too.  3) Make sparc32 use generic clockevents, from Tkhai Kirill.  [ I fixed up the BPF rules, and tried to clean up the build rules too.   But I don't have - or want - a sparc cross-build environment, so the   BPF rule bug and the related build cleanup was all done with just a   bare "make -n" pseudo-test.      - Linus ]  * git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/sparc-next: (110 commits)   sparc32: use flushi when run-time patching in per_cpu_patch   sparc32: fix cpuid_patch run-time patching   sparc32: drop unused inline functions in srmmu.c   sparc32: drop unused functions in pgtsrmmu.h   sparc32,leon: move leon mmu functions to leon_mm.c   sparc32,leon: remove duplicate definitions in leon.h   sparc32,leon: remove duplicate UART register definitions   sparc32,leon: move leon ASI definitions to asi.h   sparc32: move trap table to a separate file   sparc64: renamed ttable.S to ttable_64.S   sparc32: Remove asm/sysen.h header.   sparc32: Delete asm/smpprim.h   sparc32: Remove unused empty_bad_page{,_table} declarations.   sparc32: Kill boot_cpu_id4   sparc32: Move GET_PROCESSOR*_ID() out of asm/asmmacro.h   sparc32: Remove completely unused code from asm/cache.h   sparc32: Add ucmpdi2.o to obj-y instead of lib-y.   sparc32: add ucmpdi2   sparc: introduce arch/sparc/Kbuild   sparc: remove obsolete documentation   ...
d | math-emu |  | 5 items |  | David S. Miller | davem@davemloft.net | 1337931116 |  | sparc64: Fix several bugs in quad floating point emulation.  UltraSPARC-T2 and later do not use the fp_exception_other trap and do not set the floating point trap type field in the %fsr at all when you try to execute an unimplemented FPU operation.  Instead, it uses the illegal_instruction trap and it leaves the floating point trap type field clear.  So we should not validate the %fsr trap type field when do_mathemu() is invoked from the illegal instruction handler.  Also, the floating point trap type field is 3 bits, not 4 bits.
