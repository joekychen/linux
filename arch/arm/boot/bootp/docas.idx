As a result, using these directives in code sections can result in misaligned data words when building a Thumb-2 kernel (CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL).  This is a Bad Thing, since the ABI permits the compiler to assume that fundamental types of word size or above are word- aligned when accessing them from C.  If the data is not really word-aligned, this can cause impaired performance and stray alignment faults in some circumstances.  In general, the following rules should be applied when using data word declaration directives inside code sections:      * .quad and .double:          .align 3      * .long, .word, .single, .float:          .align (or .align 2)      * .short:         No explicit alignment required, since Thumb-2         instructions are always 2 or 4 bytes in size.         immediately after an instruction.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

Once this behavior is fixed, all files in the kernel rebuild every time, even if nothing has changed.  This patch ensures kbuild works with both the incorrect and correct behaviors of GNU make.  For more details on the incorrect behavior, see:  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-make/2006-03/msg00003.html  Changes in this patch:   - Keep all targets that are to be marked .PHONY in a variable, PHONY.   - Add .PHONY: $(PHONY) to mark them properly.   - Remove any $(PHONY) files from the $? list when determining whether     targets are up-to-date or not.
