Included are basic machine initialization files, register and interrupt definitions, support for the on-chip interrupt controller, high-precision OS timer, GPIO lines, necessary macros for early debug, pulse-width-modulated outputs control, as well as platform device configurations for the specific drivers implemented elsewhere.

Currently the following ATAGs are converted:  	ATAG_CMDLINE 	ATAG_MEM 	ATAG_INITRD2  If the corresponding information already exists in the appended DTB, it is replaced, otherwise the required node is created to hold it.  The code looks for ATAGs at the location pointed by the value of r2 upon entry into the zImage code.  If no ATAGs are found there, an attempt at finding ATAGs at the typical 0x100 offset from start of RAM is made. Otherwise the DTB is left unchanged.
