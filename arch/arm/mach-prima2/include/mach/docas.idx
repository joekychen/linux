Designed around an ARM cortex A9 core, high-speed memory bus, advanced 3D accelerator and full-HD multi-format video decoder, SiRFprimaII is able to meet the needs of complicated applications for modern multifunction devices that require heavy concurrent applications and fluid user experience. Integrated with GPS baseband, analog and PMU, this new platform is designed to provide a cost effective solution for Automotive and Consumer markets.  This patch adds the basic support for this SoC and EVB board based on device tree. It is following the ZYNQ of Xilinx in some degree.

f | debug-macro.S | g | 592B |  | Nicolas Pitre | nicolas.pitre@linaro.org | 1317046285 |  | ARM: add an extra temp register to the low level debugging addruart macro  Some platforms (like OMAP not to name it) are doing rather complicated hacks just to determine the base UART address to use.  Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
