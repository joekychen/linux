f | irqs.h | s | 5.0K | 124 | Thomas Abraham | thomas.abraham@linaro.org | 1324602279 |  | ARM: SAMSUNG: Move timer irq numbers to end of linux irq space  The timer irqs statically mapped from linux irq numbers 11 to 15 are moved to the end of the statically mapped linux irq space. The GIC PPI and SPI interrupts are relocated to start from 16 and 32 of the linux irq space. This is a required to add device tree support for GIC and Interrupt combiner for EXYNOS4.  A new macro 'IRQ_TIMER_BASE' specifies a platform specific base of the linux virq number for the timer interrupts. For exynos4, this base is set to end of the linux virq space.  For the other S5P platforms, the existing base '11' is retained.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Abraham <thomas.abraham@linaro.org> Signed-off-by: Kukjin Kim <kgene.kim@samsung.com>
f | uncompress.h | s | 4.4K | 160 | Nicolas Pitre | nicolas.pitre@linaro.org | 1304741282 |  | ARM: zImage: remove the static qualifier from global data variables  To be able to relocate the .bss section at run time independently from the rest of the code, we must make sure that no GOTOFF relocations are used with .bss symbols.  This usually means that no global variables can be marked static unless they're also const.  Let's remove the static qualifier from current offenders, or turn them into const variables when possible.  Next commit will ensure the build fails if one of those is reintroduced due to otherwise enforced coding standards for the kernel.

Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.

This means that by default, you get the trivial implementation and only have to do something extra if you need to.  This should encourage the use of the trivial default implementation.  As an additional bonus, several gpio.h header files become empty.
