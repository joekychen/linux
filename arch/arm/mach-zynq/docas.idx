This hopefully cleans it up the right way.  Signed-off-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de> Acked-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com> Acked-by: John Linn <john.linn@xilinx.com>
f | timer.c | s | 8.8K | 257 | John Linn | john.linn@xilinx.com | 1308592350 |  | ARM: Xilinx: Adding Xilinx board support  The 1st board support is minimal to get a system up and running on the Xilinx platform.  This platform reuses the clock implementation from plat-versatile, and it depends entirely on CONFIG_OF support.  There is only one board support file which obtains all device information from a device tree dtb file which is passed to the kernel at boot time.  Signed-off-by: John Linn <john.linn@xilinx.com>
f | common.h | s | 726B | 20 | Arnd Bergmann | arnd@arndb.de | 1310048038 |  | ARM: Xilinx: merge board file into main platform code  The zynq platform will never have board files other than the device tree one, so there is no point splitting it from common.c.  This makes the code more compact.  Signed-off-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de> Acked-by: John Linn <john.linn@xilinx.com>
f | Makefile.boot | g | 84B |  | Sascha Hauer | s.hauer@pengutronix.de | 1318839160 |  | ARM: 7022/1: allow to detect conflicting zreladdrs  Boards used to specify zreladdr in their Makefile.boot with zreladdr-y := x, so conflicting zreladdrs were silently overwritten. This patch changes this to zreladdr-y += x, so that we end up with multiple words in zreladdr in such a case. We can detect this later and complain if necessary.
