This platform reuses the clock implementation from plat-versatile, and it depends entirely on CONFIG_OF support.  There is only one board support file which obtains all device information from a device tree dtb file which is passed to the kernel at boot time.  Signed-off-by: John Linn <john.linn@xilinx.com>

f | debug-macro.S | g | 1017B |  | Nicolas Pitre | nicolas.pitre@linaro.org | 1317046285 |  | ARM: add an extra temp register to the low level debugging addruart macro  Some platforms (like OMAP not to name it) are doing rather complicated hacks just to determine the base UART address to use.  Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
