EP7312 - Fully functional. EP7309 - Missing SDRAM interface. EP7311 - Missing DAI. It makes no sense to separate the header files to identify these differences, it is only necessary to keep in mind the presence or lack of any features of a specific CPU when writing code.

This patch changes this to zreladdr-y += x, so that we end up with multiple words in zreladdr in such a case. We can detect this later and complain if necessary.
