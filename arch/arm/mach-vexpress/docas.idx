As the chip's GIC has 160 interrupt inputs and equivalent SMM (FPGA) has GIC synthesised with 256 interrupts, NR_IRQS is increased.  Signed-off-by: Pawel Moll <pawel.moll@arm.com>

If nothing is found, assume that there is no special SCU initialization required and initialize CPUs basing on numbers of "cpu" type devices in "cpus" node of the Device Tree.  All this happens only if the board was booted with FDT, otherwise ct_desc callbacks are used.  Signed-off-by: Pawel Moll <pawel.moll@arm.com>
