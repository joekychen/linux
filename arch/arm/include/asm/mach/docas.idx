f | map.h | s | 1.2K | 43 | Marek Szyprowski | m.szyprowski@samsung.com | 1337605778 |  | ARM: integrate CMA with DMA-mapping subsystem  This patch adds support for CMA to dma-mapping subsystem for ARM architecture. By default a global CMA area is used, but specific devices are allowed to have their private memory areas if required (they can be created with dma_declare_contiguous() function during board initialisation).  Contiguous memory areas reserved for DMA are remapped with 2-level page tables on boot. Once a buffer is requested, a low memory kernel mapping is updated to to match requested memory access type.  GFP_ATOMIC allocations are performed from special pool which is created early during boot. This way remapping page attributes is not needed on allocation time.  CMA has been enabled unconditionally for ARMv6+ systems.

Whether this a sensible thing to do is a point of contention.  This patch introduces entry/exit functions for chained handlers which infer the flow type of the primary chip as fasteoi or level-type by checking whether or not the ->irq_eoi function pointer is present and calling back to the primary chip as necessary. Other methods of flow control are not considered.
