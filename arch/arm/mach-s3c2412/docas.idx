While the original add-function only had a (struct sys_device *) parameter, the dev_add from subsys_interface needs 	(struct device *, struct subsys_interface *) leading to "initialized from incompatible pointer type" warnings.

Basically the samsung_xxx prefix is used in gpio-samsung.c instead of s3c_xxx, because unified name can reduce its complexity.  Note: some s3c_xxx stil remains because it is used widely. It will be updated next time.  Cc: Ben Dooks <ben-linux@fluff.org> Signed-off-by: Kukjin Kim <kgene.kim@samsung.com>
