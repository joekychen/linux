f | pincfg.h | s | 6.3K | 145 | Linus Walleij | linus.walleij@linaro.org | 1336727656 |  | pinctrl/nomadik: implement pin configuration  This implements the pin configuration interface for the Nomadik pin controller.  As part of the exercise we add a bit in the pin_cfg_t for the Nomadik pinctrl driver that indicates if the pin should be forced into GPIO mode. This is not done to go behind the back of the GPIO subsystem, but to ensure that default modes can be set by hogs on boot and system suspend/resume states. It was used implicitly by the old code defining all config settings and modes in a single config word but we now have a split between pinmux and pinconf leading to the need to have this.  We also add a bit for explicitly setting sleepmode of the pin. This was previously handled by custom calls with the _sleep() suffix, but we now have one single interface into the configuration so we replace this with a bit indicating that the pin shall be configured into sleep mode.  Some of the configuration can be refactored later to use less custom fields on the pin_cfg_t but we are currently leaving the old function calls in place so we stay compatible.  ChangeLog v1->v2: - Drop a hunk changing pinmuxing for GPIO and move it   over to the preceding pinmux patch.
