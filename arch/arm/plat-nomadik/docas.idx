Change it to use the new one instead.  Signed-off-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de> Reviewed-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

It is now possible to make the sched_clock framework mandatory, effectively preventing new platforms to add new sched_clock() functions, which would be detrimental to the single zImage work.
