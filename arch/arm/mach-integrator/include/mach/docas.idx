f | irqs.h | s | 2.3K | 78 | Linus Walleij | linus.walleij@linaro.org | 1336146817 |  | ARM: 7389/2: plat-versatile: modernize FPGA IRQ controller  This does two things to the FPGA IRQ controller in the versatile family:  - Convert to MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER so we can drop the entry macro   from the Integrator. The C IRQ handler was inspired from   arch/arm/common/vic.c, recent bug discovered in this handler was   accounted for. - Convert to using IRQ domains so we can get rid of the NO_IRQ   mess and proceed with device tree and such stuff.  As part of the exercise, bump all the low IRQ numbers on the Integrator PIC to start from 1 rather than 0, since IRQ 0 is now NO_IRQ. The Linux IRQ numbers are thus entirely decoupled from the hardware IRQ numbers in this controller.  I was unable to split this patch. The main reason is the half-done conversion to device tree in Versatile.  Tested on Integrator/AP and Integrator/CP.

Integrator/CP supports RGB565 via an external multiplexer, which we configure for RGB5551 or RGB565 based only on the bits per pixel.  So when userspace asks for the RGB555 layout, the mux remains in RGB565 mode, and we produce incorrect colours.  Fix this.  Note that Integrator doesn't support BGR565 mode, but does support BGR5551.  Acked-by: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com> Signed-off-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>

This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
