f | gpio.h | s | 12B | 1 | Russell King | rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk | 1313135659 |  | ARM: gpio: make trivial GPIOLIB implementation the default  Rather than marking the mach/gpio.h header files which want to use the trivial GPIOLIB implementation, mark those which do not want to use it instead.  This means that by default, you get the trivial implementation and only have to do something extra if you need to.  This should encourage the use of the trivial default implementation.  As an additional bonus, several gpio.h header files become empty.
