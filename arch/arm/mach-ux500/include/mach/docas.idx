This is an application processor without internal modem. This is the most basic part with ASIC ID, CPU-related fixes, IRQ list, register ranges, timer, UART, and L2 cache setup. This is based on a patch by Michel Jaouen which was rewritten to fit with the latest 3.3 kernel.  ChangeLog v1->v2: deleted the irqs-db9540.h file since we expect to   migrate to using Device Tree for getting the IRQs to devices. ChangeLog v2->v3: introduced a fixed virtual offset for the ROM   as suggested by Arnd Bergmann.

This is particularly prudent with the introduction of /sys/devices/socX, as a device can now proclaim to be integral part of an SoC, rather than a more generic platform device. Latter patches make good use of this functionality.  Signed-off-by: Lee Jones <lee.jones@linaro.org> Acked-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org> Signed-off-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
