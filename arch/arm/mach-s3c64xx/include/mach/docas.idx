This patch adds support for such boards, by calculating hclk2 depending on the status of S3C_OTHERS_SYNCMUXSEL bit in S3C64XX_OTHERS regist  Signed-off-by: Tomasz Figa <tomasz.figa@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Kukjin Kim <kgene.kim@samsung.com>

Basically the samsung_xxx prefix is used in gpio-samsung.c instead of s3c_xxx, because unified name can reduce its complexity.  Note: some s3c_xxx stil remains because it is used widely. It will be updated next time.  Cc: Ben Dooks <ben-linux@fluff.org> Signed-off-by: Kukjin Kim <kgene.kim@samsung.com>

This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
