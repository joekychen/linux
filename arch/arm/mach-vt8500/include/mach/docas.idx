Support is included for both VT8500 and WM8505, selectable by a configuration switch at kernel build time.  Included are basic machine initialization files, register and interrupt definitions, support for the on-chip interrupt controller, high-precision OS timer, GPIO lines, necessary macros for early debug, pulse-width-modulated outputs control, as well as platform device configurations for the specific drivers implemented elsewhere.

This means that by default, you get the trivial implementation and only have to do something extra if you need to.  This should encourage the use of the trivial default implementation.  As an additional bonus, several gpio.h header files become empty.

Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
