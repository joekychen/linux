Support is included for both VT8500 and WM8505, selectable by a configuration switch at kernel build time.  Included are basic machine initialization files, register and interrupt definitions, support for the on-chip interrupt controller, high-precision OS timer, GPIO lines, necessary macros for early debug, pulse-width-modulated outputs control, as well as platform device configurations for the specific drivers implemented elsewhere.
