This also removes the requirement for a platform to have a mach/hardware.h.  The default values for i/o and mem are 0x1000 and 0x01000000, respectively. Per Arnd Bergmann, other values are likely to be incorrect, but this commit does not try to address that issue.

Essentially:    - as we no longer support any other Acorn platforms other than RiscPC      anymore, we can collect all that code into mach-rpc.    - convert Acorn expansion card stuff to use IRQ allocation functions,      and get rid of NO_IRQ from there.    - cleanups to the ebsa110 platform to move some private stuff out of      its header files.    - large amount of SA11x0 updates:    - conversion of private DMA implementation to DMA engine support      (this actually gives us greater flexibility in drivers over the old      API.)    - re-worked ucb1x00 updates - convert to genirq, remove sa11x0      dependencies, fix various minor issues    - move platform specific sa11x0 framebuffer data into platform files      in arch/arm instead of keeping this in the driver itself    - update sa11x0 IrDA driver for DMA engine, and allow it to use DMA      for SIR transmissions as well as FIR    - rework sa1111 support for genirq, and irq allocation    - fix sa1111 IRQ support so it works again    - use sparse IRQ support    After this, I have one more pull request remaining from my current   set, which I think is going to be the most problematical as it   generates 8 conflicts."
