Rather than having almost every platform specify the standard swizzle function, make this the default when no swizzle function is supplied. Therefore, a swizzle function only needs to be provided when there is something exceptional which needs to be handled.  This gets rid of the swizzle initializer from 47 files, and leaves us with just two platforms specifying a swizzle function: ARM Integrator and Chalice CATS.

The iop342 processor replaces the SAS controller with a second Xscale core for dual core embedded applications.  The iop341 processor is the single core version of iop342.  This patch supports the two Intel customer reference platforms iq81340mc for external storage and iq81340sc for direct attach (HBA) development.

This patch changes this to zreladdr-y += x, so that we end up with multiple words in zreladdr in such a case. We can detect this later and complain if necessary.
