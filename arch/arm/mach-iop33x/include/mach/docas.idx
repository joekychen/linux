This also removes the requirement for a platform to have a mach/hardware.h.  The default values for i/o and mem are 0x1000 and 0x01000000, respectively. Per Arnd Bergmann, other values are likely to be incorrect, but this commit does not try to address that issue.

Currently, on iop32x, only the lower window is available for allocations, limiting the available space to 64 MB. On iop33x the full 128 MB can be allocated, but the translation value is wrong for the upper window.  The patch enables the full 128 MB space on iop32x and corrects the initialization of OMWTVR1. Redundant definitions are deleted. Tested using a Thecus N2100 board with a graphics adapter in the expansion slot. Both windows are in use:    00:05.0 VGA compatible controller: XGI Technology Inc.

This usually means that no global variables can be marked static unless they're also const.  Let's remove the static qualifier from current offenders, or turn them into const variables when possible.  Next commit will ensure the build fails if one of those is reintroduced due to otherwise enforced coding standards for the kernel.

Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
