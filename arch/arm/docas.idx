ARM builds seem to be plagued by an occasional build error:      Inconsistent kallsyms data     This is a bug - please report about it     Try "make KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=1" as a workaround  The problem has to do with alignment of some sections by the linker. The kallsyms data is built in two passes by first linking the kernel without it, and then linking the kernel again with the symbols included.  Normally, this just shifts the symbols, without changing their order, and the compression used by the kallsyms gives the same result.  On non SMP, the per CPU data is empty.  Depending on the where the alignment ends up, it can come out as either:     +-------------------+    || last text segment ||    +-------------------+    /* padding */    +-------------------+     <- L1_CACHE_BYTES alignemnt    || per cpu (empty)   ||    +-------------------+ __per_cpu_end:    /* padding */ __data_loc:    +-------------------+     <- THREAD_SIZE alignment    || data              ||    +-------------------+  or     +-------------------+    || last text segment ||    +-------------------+    /* padding */    +-------------------+     <- L1_CACHE_BYTES alignemnt    || per cpu (empty)   ||    +-------------------+ __per_cpu_end:    /* no padding */ __data_loc:    +-------------------+     <- THREAD_SIZE alignment    || data              ||    +-------------------+  if the alignment satisfies both.  Because symbols that have the same address are sorted by 'nm -n', the second case will be in a different order than the first case.  This changes the compression, changing the size of the kallsym data, causing the build failure.  The KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=1 workaround usually works, but it is still possible to have the alignment change between the second and third pass.  It's probably even possible for it to never reach a fixedpoint.  The problem only occurs on non-SMP, when the per-cpu data is empty, and when the data segment has alignment (and immediately follows the text segments).  Fix this by only including the per_cpu section on SMP, when it is not empty.  Signed-off-by: David Brown <davidb@codeaurora.org> Signed-off-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>

Hopefully this works for all clients. Platform callbacks are bad for device tree migration anyway, so this rids us of another problem in Ux500.

Rather than having almost every platform specify the standard swizzle function, make this the default when no swizzle function is supplied. Therefore, a swizzle function only needs to be provided when there is something exceptional which needs to be handled.

This patch fixes that and prepares for further I/O space clean-up.  I/O space handling on the versatile platform is currently broken in multiple ways. Most importantly, the ports do not get mapped into the virtual address space at all.  Also, there is some amount of confusion between PCI I/O space and other statically mapped MMIO registers in the platform code:  * The __io_address() macro that is used to access the   platform register maps to the same __io macro that gets   used for I/O space.  * The IO_SPACE_LIMIT is set to a value that is much larger   than the total available space.  * The I/O resource of the PCI bus is set to the physical   address of the mapping, which is way outside of the   actual I/O space limit as well as the address range that   gets decoded by traditional PCI cards.  * No attempt is made to stay outside of the ISA port range   that some device drivers try access.  * No resource gets requested as a child of ioport_resource,   but an IORESOURCE_IO type mapping gets requested   as a child of iomem_resource.  This patch attempts to correct all of the above. This makes it possible to use virtio-pci based virtual devices as well as actual PCI cards including those with legacy ISA port ranges like VGA.  Some of the issues seem to be duplicated on other platforms.

Per feedback from Paul and Benoit the 4470 clock data is incomplete for new modules such as the 2D graphics block that has been added to the 4470. Therefore add a warning to indicate that the clock data is incomplete.

Unfortunately, this is still needed for the definition of IO_SPACE_LIMIT which overrides the default 64K. All Orion based systems have 1Mbyte of IO space per PCI[e] bus, and try to request_resource() this size. Orion5x has two such PCI buses.  It is likely that the original, removed version, was broken. This version might be less broken. However, it has not been tested on hardware with a PCI card, let alone hardware with a PCI card with IO capabilities.

The C IRQ handler was inspired from   arch/arm/common/vic.c, recent bug discovered in this handler was   accounted for. - Convert to using IRQ domains so we can get rid of the NO_IRQ   mess and proceed with device tree and such stuff.  As part of the exercise, bump all the low IRQ numbers on the Integrator PIC to start from 1 rather than 0, since IRQ 0 is now NO_IRQ. The Linux IRQ numbers are thus entirely decoupled from the hardware IRQ numbers in this controller.  I was unable to split this patch. The main reason is the half-done conversion to device tree in Versatile.  Tested on Integrator/AP and Integrator/CP.
