The C IRQ handler was inspired from   arch/arm/common/vic.c, recent bug discovered in this handler was   accounted for. - Convert to using IRQ domains so we can get rid of the NO_IRQ   mess and proceed with device tree and such stuff.  As part of the exercise, bump all the low IRQ numbers on the Integrator PIC to start from 1 rather than 0, since IRQ 0 is now NO_IRQ. The Linux IRQ numbers are thus entirely decoupled from the hardware IRQ numbers in this controller.  I was unable to split this patch. The main reason is the half-done conversion to device tree in Versatile.  Tested on Integrator/AP and Integrator/CP.

f | clcd.h | s | 293B | 7 | Russell King | rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk | 1298113752 |  | ARM: add versatile family consolidated CLCD support  This consolidates the CLCD panel definitions and memory allocation into one location.  Rename the Sanyo 2.5in and Epson 2.2in displays after their respective part numbers.  Rather than using a general "Sanyo 2.5in" and "Epson 2.2in" description of the display panel, use the manufacturers part number to be more specific.  This helps people identify what the timings actually refer to, which are panel specific.  While here, add CLCD capability information to each panel definition, which has no effect until we add the board-level capabilities.
