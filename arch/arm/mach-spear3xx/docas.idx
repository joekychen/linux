f | Makefile.boot | g | 226B |  | Viresh Kumar | viresh.kumar@st.com | 1335127295 |  | ARM: SPEAr3xx: Add device-tree support to SPEAr3xx architecture  This patch adds a generic target for SPEAr3xx machines that can be configured via the device-tree. Currently the following devices are supported via the devicetree:  - VIC interrupts - PL011 UART - PL061 GPIO - PL110 CLCD - SP805 WDT - Synopsys DW I2C - Synopsys DW ethernet - ST FSMC-NAND - ST SPEAR-SMI - ST SPEAR-KEYBOARD - ST SPEAR-RTC - ARASAN SDHCI-SPEAR - SPEAR-EHCI - SPEAR-OHCI  Other peripheral devices will follow in later patches.  This also removes IO_ADDRESS macro and creates 16 MB static mappings instead of 4K for individual peripherals. This is done to have efficient TLB lookup for any I/O windows that are located closely together. ioremap() on this range will return this mapping only instead of creating another.
