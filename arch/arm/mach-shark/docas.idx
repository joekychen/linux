f | pci.c | s | 962B | 43 | Russell King | rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk | 1336925537 |  | ARM: PCI: provide a default bus scan implementation  Most PCI implementations perform simple root bus scanning.  Rather than having each group of platforms provide a duplicated bus scan function, provide the PCI configuration ops structure via the hw_pci structure, and call the root bus scanning function from core ARM PCI code.

f | dma.c | s | 367B | 20 | Russell King | rmk@dyn-67.arm.linux.org.uk | 1229005963 |  | [ARM] dma: rejig DMA initialization  Rather than having the central DMA multiplexer call the architecture specific DMA initialization function, have each architecture DMA initialization function use core_initcall(), and register each DMA channel separately with the multiplexer.  This removes the array of dma structures in the central multiplexer, replacing it with an array of pointers instead; this is more flexible since it allows the drivers to wrap the DMA structure (eventually allowing us to transition non-ISA DMA drivers away.)

f | Makefile | g | 158B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
f | core.c | s | 3.5K | 145 | Olof Johansson | olof@lixom.net | 1333147480 |  | ARM: fix builds due to missing <asm/system_misc.h> includes  This does a sweeping change fixing up all the missing system_misc.h and system_info.h includes from the system.h split-up change. These were the ones I came across when building all defconfigs in arch/arm/configs, there might be more but they lack adequate build coverage to be easily caught.  I'm expecting to get a lot of these piecemeal by each maintainer, so we might just as well do one sweeping change to get them all at once.
