f | debug-macro.S | g | 586B |  | Nicolas Pitre | nicolas.pitre@linaro.org | 1317046285 |  | ARM: add an extra temp register to the low level debugging addruart macro  Some platforms (like OMAP not to name it) are doing rather complicated hacks just to determine the base UART address to use.  Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
