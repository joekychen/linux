This IRQ is used on the U300 so we're missing it now. Bump all IRQ numbers by one since they are now decoupled from the hardware IRQ numbers.

f | debug-macro.S | g | 598B |  | Nicolas Pitre | nicolas.pitre@linaro.org | 1317046285 |  | ARM: add an extra temp register to the low level debugging addruart macro  Some platforms (like OMAP not to name it) are doing rather complicated hacks just to determine the base UART address to use.  Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.

In the process we rename the U300 "pinmux-u300" to "pinctrl-u300" so as not to confuse.  Signed-off-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>
f | syscon.h | s | 24K | 596 | Linus Walleij | linus.walleij@linaro.org | 1318503465 |  | pinctrl: add a driver for the U300 pinmux  This adds a driver for the U300 pinmux portions of the system controller "SYSCON". It also serves as an example of how to use the pinmux subsystem. This driver also houses the platform data for the only supported platform.  This deletes the old U300 driver in arch/arm/mach-u300 and replace it with a driver using the new subsystem.  The new driver is considerably fatter than the old one, but it also registers all 467 pins of the system and adds the power and EMIF pin groups and corresponding functions. The idea is to use this driver as a a reference for other implementation so it needs to be as complete and verbose as possible.
