And this patch is including following. - re-ordered alphabetically by option text at Kconfig and Makefile - removed unused option, MACH_N35 - fixed duplcated option name, S3C2410_DMA to S3C24XX_DMA which is   in plat-s3c24xx/  Cc: Ben Dooks <ben-linux@fluff.org> Cc: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk> Signed-off-by: Kukjin Kim <kgene.kim@samsung.com>

While the original add-function only had a (struct sys_device *) parameter, the dev_add from subsys_interface needs 	(struct device *, struct subsys_interface *) leading to "initialized from incompatible pointer type" warnings.
