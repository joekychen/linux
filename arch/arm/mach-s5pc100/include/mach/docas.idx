This SoC is successor of S3C64XX. S5PC100 has peripherals which are still similar to S3C families so some drivers in "arch/arm/plat-s3c" can be shared.

This means that by default, you get the trivial implementation and only have to do something extra if you need to.  This should encourage the use of the trivial default implementation.  As an additional bonus, several gpio.h header files become empty.

The GIC PPI and SPI interrupts are relocated to start from 16 and 32 of the linux irq space. This is a required to add device tree support for GIC and Interrupt combiner for EXYNOS4.  A new macro 'IRQ_TIMER_BASE' specifies a platform specific base of the linux virq number for the timer interrupts. For exynos4, this base is set to end of the linux virq space.  For the other S5P platforms, the existing base '11' is retained.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Abraham <thomas.abraham@linaro.org> Signed-off-by: Kukjin Kim <kgene.kim@samsung.com>

Let's give their addruart macro some slack by providing an extra work register which will allow for much needed cleanups.  This is basically a no-op as this commit is only adding the extra argument to the macro but no one is using it yet.
