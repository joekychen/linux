f | leds.h | s | 1.6K | 43 | David Howells | dhowells@redhat.com | 1239370428 |  | Separate out the proc- and unit-specific header directories from the general MN10300 arch headers and place them instead in the same directories as contain the .c files for the processor and unit implementations.  This permits the symlinks include/asm/proc and include/asm/unit to be dispensed with.  This does, however, require that #include <asm/proc/xxx.h> be converted to #include <proc/xxx.h> and similarly for asm/unit -> unit.  Signed-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
