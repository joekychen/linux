Tsirkin | mst@redhat.com | 1323007217 |  | mn10300: switch to GENERIC_PCI_IOMAP  The pci_iomap variant that arch/mn10300/unit-asb2305/pci-iomap.c uses differs from the generic one in that it does not use ioremap_nocache for PCI addresses. However, it turns out that PCI addresses are automatically noncached, so switching to ioremap_nocache and to the generic implementation is safe.  Signed-off-by: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@redhat.com>

Move the KM_FENCE_ macro additions into asm-generic/kmap_types.h, controlled by __WITH_KM_FENCE from each arch's kmap_types.h file.  Would be nice to be able to add custom KM_types per arch, but I don't yet see a nice, clean way to do that.  Built on x86_64, i386, mips, sparc, alpha(tonyb), powerpc(tonyb), and 68k(tonyb).  Note: avr32 should be able to remove KM_PTE2 (since it's not used) and then just use the generic kmap_types.h file.  Get avr32 maintainer approval.

We cannot use CONFIG_64BIT for this in headers that are included from user space because CONFIG symbols are not available there. We also cannot do it inside of asm/types.h because some headers need the word size but cannot include types.h.  The solution is to introduce a new header <asm/bitsperlong.h> that defines both __BITS_PER_LONG for user space and BITS_PER_LONG for usage in the kernel. The asm-generic version falls back to 32 bit unless the architecture overrides it, which I did for all 64 bit platforms.

So it hasn't been so useful for drivers.  We have only one user of the API in tree.  Unlikely out-of-tree drivers use the API.  Even if we fix dma_is_consistent() in some architectures, it doesn't look useful at all.  It was invented long ago for some old systems that can't allocate coherent memory at all.  It's better to export only APIs that are definitely necessary for drivers.  Let's remove this API.

f | termbits.h | s | 4.6K | 185 | hyc@symas.com | hyc@symas.com | 1281473259 |  | tty: Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE  This patch is against the 2.6.34 source.  Paraphrased from the 1989 BSD patch by David Borman @ cray.com:       These are the changes needed for the kernel to support      LINEMODE in the server.       There is a new bit in the termios local flag word, EXTPROC.      When this bit is set, several aspects of the terminal driver      are disabled.  Input line editing, character echo, and mapping      of signals are all disabled.  This allows the telnetd to turn      off these functions when in linemode, but still keep track of      what state the user wants the terminal to be in.       New ioctl:          TIOCSIG         Generate a signal to processes in the                          current process group of the pty.       There is a new mode for packet driver, the TIOCPKT_IOCTL bit.      When packet mode is turned on in the pty, and the EXTPROC bit      is set, then whenever the state of the pty is changed, the      next read on the master side of the pty will have the TIOCPKT_IOCTL      bit set.  This allows the process on the server side of the pty      to know when the state of the terminal has changed; it can then      issue the appropriate ioctl to retrieve the new state.  Since the original BSD patches accompanied the source code for telnet I've left that reference here, but obviously the feature is useful for any remote terminal protocol, including ssh.  The corresponding feature has existed in the BSD tty driver since 1989.

The problem is that MN10300's implementation of BUG() invokes system call 15 which doesn't return - but there's no way to tell the compiler that and also emit the bug table element with the correct file and line data.  So instead, we make the do...while wrapper in _debug_bug_trap() an endless loop from which there's no escape.  Also, while we're at it, (1) get rid of _debug_bug_trap() and just implement directly as BUG(), and (2) make the implementation of BUG() contingent on CONFIG_BUG=y.

While doing this I have noticed that we have some architectures that are very slow to get new system calls.  cris seems to be the slowest where the last system calls wired up were preadv and pwritev.  avr32 is weird in that recvmmsg was wired up but never declared in unistd.h.  frv is behind with perf_event_open being the last syscall wired up.

Thus it is important to (at least) clobber the MDR register in relevant inline assembly fragments, lest RETF be used incorrectly.  The only instances I could find are here.  There are reads of the MDR register in kernel/gdb-stub.c, but that's harmless.  Although, frankly, __builtin_return_address(0) might be a better thing in those cases.

However, rather than being done through a pair of instructions, it's driven by writing to a pair of memory-mapped CPU control registers.  One set of these registers (AARU/ADRU/ASRU) is available for use by userspace, but for userspace to access them a PTE must be set up to cover the region. This is done by dedicating the first vmalloc region page to this purpose, setting the permissions on its PTE such that userspace can access the page.  glibc is hardcoded to expect the registers to be there.  The way atomic ops are done through these registers is straightforward:   (1) Write the address of the word you wish to access into AARU.  This causes      the CPU to go and fetch that word and load it into ADRU.  The status bits      are also cleared in ASRU.   (2) The current data value is read from the ADRU register and modified.   (3) To alter the data in RAM, the revised data is written back to the ADRU      register, which causes the CPU to attempt to write it back.   (4) The ASRU.RW flag (ASRU read watch), ASRU.LW flag (bus lock watch),      ASRU.IW (interrupt watch) and the ASRU.BW (bus error watch) flags then      must be checked to confirm that the operation wasn't aborted.  If any of      the watches have been set to true, the operation was aborted.  Signed-off-by: Mark Salter <msalter@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
