To fix this, make the inclusion of linux/slab.h contingent on NO_INFLATE_MALLOC as are the usages of kmalloc() and kfree().  In MN10300, this causes the following errors:  In file included from include/linux/string.h:21,                  from include/linux/bitmap.h:8,                  from include/linux/nodemask.h:93,                  from include/linux/mmzone.h:16,                  from include/linux/gfp.h:4,                  from include/linux/slab.h:12,                  from arch/mn10300/boot/compressed/../../../../lib/inflate.c:106,                  from arch/mn10300/boot/compressed/misc.c:170: /warthog/am33/linux-2.6-mn10300/arch/mn10300/include/asm/string.h:19: error: conflicting types for 'memset' arch/mn10300/boot/compressed/misc.c:59: error: previous definition of 'memset' was here  Signed-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
