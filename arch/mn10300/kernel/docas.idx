The breakpoints are removed by switch_to() and reinstalled on switching back so that if preemption occurs, the preempting task doesn't hit them (though it will still hit KGDB's regular breakpoints).  If KGDB is reentered for any reason, then the single step breakpoint is completely erased and must be set again by the debugger.  We take advantage of the fact that KGDB will effectively halt all other CPUs whilst this CPU is single-stepping to avoid SMP problems.  If the single-stepping task is preempted and killed without KGDB being reinvoked, then the breakpoint(s) will be cleared and KGDB will be jumped back into.

f | sys_mn10300.c | s | 1001B | 31 | Christoph Hellwig | hch@lst.de | 1268437952 |  | Add generic sys_ipc wrapper  Add a generic implementation of the ipc demultiplexer syscall.  Except for s390 and sparc64 all implementations of the sys_ipc are nearly identical.  There are slight differences in the types of the parameters, where mips and powerpc as the only 64-bit architectures with sys_ipc use unsigned long for the "third" argument as it gets casted to a pointer later, while it traditionally is an "int" like most other paramters.  frv goes even further and uses unsigned long for all parameters execept for "ptr" which is a pointer type everywhere.  The change from int to unsigned long for "third" and back to "int" for the others on frv should be fine due to the in-register calling conventions for syscalls (we already had a similar issue with the generic sys_ptrace), but I'd prefer to have the arch maintainers looks over this in details.  Except for that h8300, m68k and m68knommu lack an impplementation of the semtimedop sub call which this patch adds, and various architectures have gets used - at least on i386 it seems superflous as the compat code on x86-64 and ia64 doesn't even bother to implement it.

The message is a nuisance and repeats spamming the log.    See: http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-trbl-spec.htm#Q-LINUX-SET-RTC-MMSS  Rather than just removing the message, make it show only once and reduce severity since it indicates a normal and non urgent condition.

All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).
