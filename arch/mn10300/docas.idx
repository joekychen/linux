All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

f | Kconfig | g | 11K |  | Thomas Gleixner | tglx@linutronix.de | 1337636626 |  | timers: Fixup the Kconfig consolidation fallout  Sigh, I missed to check which architecture Kconfig files actually include the core Kconfig file. There are a few which did not. So we broke them.  Instead of adding the includes to those, we are better off to move the include to init/Kconfig like we did already with irqs and others.  This does not change anything for the architectures using the old style periodic timer mode. It just solves the build wreckage there.  For those architectures which use the clock events infrastructure it moves the include of the core Kconfig file to "General setup" which is a way more logical place than having it at random locations specified by the architecture specific Kconfigs.

d | configs |  | 2 items |  | Daniel Lezcano | daniel.lezcano@free.fr | 1306455154 |  | cgroup: remove the ns_cgroup  The ns_cgroup is an annoying cgroup at the namespace / cgroup frontier and leads to some problems:    * cgroup creation is out-of-control   * cgroup name can conflict when pids are looping   * it is not possible to have a single process handling a lot of     namespaces without falling in a exponential creation time   * we may want to create a namespace without creating a cgroup    The ns_cgroup was replaced by a compatibility flag 'clone_children',   where a newly created cgroup will copy the parent cgroup values.   The userspace has to manually create a cgroup and add a task to   the 'tasks' file.  This patch removes the ns_cgroup as suggested in the following thread:  https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2009-June/018616.html  The 'cgroup_clone' function is removed because it is no longer used.  This is a userspace-visible change.  Commit 45531757b45c ("cgroup: notify ns_cgroup deprecated") (merged into 2.6.27) caused the kernel to emit a printk warning users that the feature is planned for removal.  Since that time we have heard from XXX users who were affected by this.  Signed-off-by: Daniel Lezcano <daniel.lezcano@free.fr> Signed-off-by: Serge E. Hallyn <serge.hallyn@canonical.com> Cc: Eric W.
