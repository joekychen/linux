f | inode.c | s | 12K | 455 | Jan Kara | jack@suse.cz | 1336283021 |  | vfs: Rename end_writeback() to clear_inode()  After we moved inode_sync_wait() from end_writeback() it doesn't make sense to call the function end_writeback() anymore. Rename it to clear_inode() which well says what the function really does - set I_CLEAR flag.  Signed-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz> Signed-off-by: Fengguang Wu <fengguang.wu@intel.com>

This has the drawback that a user (root) can pin that memory by not closing the file. This patch moves the buffer allocation to the read function. The buffer is automatically released after the buffer is copied to userspace.  Signed-off-by: Michael Holzheu <holzheu@linux.vnet.ibm.com> Signed-off-by: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
