Somehow a few bits got upstream anyway. Since kerntypes aren't used anymore and lcrash isn't maintained (for s390 at least) remove the last traces of kerntypes that somehow went upstream. Also remove the documentation that mentions lcrash.  Signed-off-by: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com> Signed-off-by: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
f | install.sh | s | 920B | 32 | Sam Ravnborg | sam@ravnborg.org | 1253441894 |  | kbuild: use INSTALLKERNEL to select customized installkernel script  Replace the use of CROSS_COMPILE to select a customized installkernel script with the possibility to set INSTALLKERNEL to select a custom installkernel script when running make:      make INSTALLKERNEL=arm-installkernel install  With this patch we are now more consistent across different architectures - they did not all support use of CROSS_COMPILE.  The use of CROSS_COMPILE was a hack as this really belongs to gcc/binutils and the installkernel script does not change just because we change toolchain.  The use of CROSS_COMPILE caused troubles with an upcoming patch that saves CROSS_COMPILE when a kernel is built - it would no longer be installable. [Thanks to Peter Z. for this hint]  This patch undos what Ian did in commit:    0f8e2d62fa04441cd12c08ce521e84e5bd3f8a46   ("use ${CROSS_COMPILE}installkernel in arch/*/boot/install.sh")  The patch has been lightly tested on x86 only - but all changes looks obvious.
