This patch removes the respective files to decrease merging conflicts and unneeded maintenance.

There is no need to compile it for the rest of the PowerPC platforms or for any of the other architectures.  This patch makes iseries and pseries select CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC, and makes it default to off for everything else.  It is still safe to turn on CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC on all architectures, it just isn't necessary.  v2: Also select OF_DYNAMIC for PPC_CHROMA and MPC885ADS as reported by Michael     Meuling  Signed-off-by: Grant Likely <grant.likely@secretlab.ca> Acked-by: David S.
