Or plain an ugly sin.

f | setup.c | s | 4.3K | 138 | Grant Likely | grant.likely@secretlab.ca | 1280648562 |  | of/address: Clean up function declarations  This patch moves the declaration of of_get_address(), of_get_pci_address(), and of_pci_address_to_resource() out of arch code and into the common linux/of_address header file.  This patch also fixes some of the asm/prom.h ordering issues.  It still includes some header files that it ideally shouldn't be, but at least the ordering is consistent now so that of_* overrides work.  Signed-off-by: Grant Likely <grant.likely@secretlab.ca>

These boards were sold by Eyetech and are based on MAI Logic's Teron boards and its Articia S northbridge. The AmigaOne uses U-boot as firmware, which doesn't support a flattened device tree yet. The northbridge has some design flaws, which makes it necessary to use non cacheable memory for DMA operations (CONFIG_NOT_COHERENT_CACHE) and to avoid setting the coherence (M) flag for memory pages.
