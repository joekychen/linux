f | motionpro_defconfig | g | 2.5K |  | Stephen Rothwell | sfr@canb.auug.org.au | 1301441783 |  | powerpc: Restore some misc devices to our configs  Uwe Kleine-König reported:  	while working on an defconfig (arm/mx27) I noticed that just updating 	it[1] results in removing CONFIG_EEPROM_AT24=y.  The reason is that 	since commit  		v2.6.36-5965-g5f2365d (misc devices: do not enable by default)  	MISC_DEVICES isn't enabled anymore by default.  So all defconfigs that 	have CONFIG_SOME_SYMBOL=y (or =m) (with SOME_SYMBOL depending on 	MISC_DEVICES) but not CONFIG_MISC_DEVICES=y suffer from the same 	problem.  This restores those misc devices to the powerpc defconfigs.

f | cm5200_defconfig | g | 2.2K |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.
