In commit 9aa3283595451ca093500ff0977b106e1f465586 (ehea/ibm*: Move the IBM drivers) the IBM_NEW_EMAC* were renames to IBM_EMAC*  The conversion was incomplete so that even if the driver was added to the .config it wasn't built, but there were no errors).  In this commit we also update the various defconfigs that use EMAC to use the new Kconfig symbol, and explicitly add the NET_VENDOR_IBM guard.  We do not explicitly select the Kconfig dependencies, as this would force EMAC on.  Doing it in the defconfig allows more flexibility.  Tested on a canyondlands board.

It features a PowerPC 405 processor core built in a 65nm low-power CMOS process with a five-stage pipeline executing up to one instruction per cycle. The family has 128-kbytes of on-chip memory, a 128-bit local bus and on-chip DDR2 SDRAM controller with 16-bit interface.

This adds it using ppc40x_simple and provides a device-tree.  There are some changes to the boot wrapper because the way u-boot works on this thing, it seems to expect a multipart image with the kernel, initrd and dtb in it.  The USB support is missing as it needs the yet unmerged driver for the DWC OTG part and the GPIOs may need further definition in the dts.
