In commit 9aa3283595451ca093500ff0977b106e1f465586 (ehea/ibm*: Move the IBM drivers) the IBM_NEW_EMAC* were renames to IBM_EMAC*  The conversion was incomplete so that even if the driver was added to the .config it wasn't built, but there were no errors).  In this commit we also update the various defconfigs that use EMAC to use the new Kconfig symbol, and explicitly add the NET_VENDOR_IBM guard.  We do not explicitly select the Kconfig dependencies, as this would force EMAC on.  Doing it in the defconfig allows more flexibility.  Tested on a canyondlands board.

f | rainier_defconfig | g | 2.0K |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.

This approach however is not enough for platforms, where the TLB page size is large (e.g, 256M on 44x). So we are renaming the RELOCATABLE used currently in BookE to DYNAMIC_MEMSTART to reflect the actual method.  The CONFIG_RELOCATABLE for PPC32(BookE) based on processing of the dynamic relocations will be introduced in the later in the patch series.  This change would allow the use of the old method of RELOCATABLE for platforms which can afford to enforce the page alignment (platforms with smaller TLB size).  Changes since v3:  * Introduced a new config, NONSTATIC_KERNEL, to denote a kernel which is   either a RELOCATABLE or DYNAMIC_MEMSTART(Suggested by: Josh Boyer)  Suggested-by: Scott Wood <scottwood@freescale.com> Tested-by: Scott Wood <scottwood@freescale.com>  Signed-off-by: Suzuki K.
