This patch moves the driver from the 86xx specific platform directrory to the GPIO subsystem so that it can be used on non-86xx boards.

The patch merges sound/soc/imx into sound/soc/fsl, so that the possible code sharing and consolidation can happen.  This is a plain merge, except that menuconfig SND_POWERPC_SOC is added in Kconfig for PowerPC platform as a correspondence to SND_IMX_SOC for IMX platform.

This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.

While some end users may prefer to save the space, as a default on a kernel config aimed primarily at development on reference boards, it should be enabled.
