f | holly_defconfig | g | 1.6K |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.

The patch merges sound/soc/imx into sound/soc/fsl, so that the possible code sharing and consolidation can happen.  This is a plain merge, except that menuconfig SND_POWERPC_SOC is added in Kconfig for PowerPC platform as a correspondence to SND_IMX_SOC for IMX platform.

With feature fixups there is   little downside to compiling this in.  - It uses the newer mtocrf instruction in various assembly functions.   Instead of making this a compile option just do it at runtime via   a feature fixup.  Signed-off-by: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org> Signed-off-by: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>

d | 44x |  | 17 items |  | Suzuki Poulose | suzuki@in.ibm.com | 1324394419 |  | powerpc: Rename mapping based RELOCATABLE to DYNAMIC_MEMSTART for BookE  The current implementation of CONFIG_RELOCATABLE in BookE is based on mapping the page aligned kernel load address to KERNELBASE. This approach however is not enough for platforms, where the TLB page size is large (e.g, 256M on 44x). So we are renaming the RELOCATABLE used currently in BookE to DYNAMIC_MEMSTART to reflect the actual method.  The CONFIG_RELOCATABLE for PPC32(BookE) based on processing of the dynamic relocations will be introduced in the later in the patch series.  This change would allow the use of the old method of RELOCATABLE for platforms which can afford to enforce the page alignment (platforms with smaller TLB size).  Changes since v3:  * Introduced a new config, NONSTATIC_KERNEL, to denote a kernel which is   either a RELOCATABLE or DYNAMIC_MEMSTART(Suggested by: Josh Boyer)  Suggested-by: Scott Wood <scottwood@freescale.com> Tested-by: Scott Wood <scottwood@freescale.com>  Signed-off-by: Suzuki K.
