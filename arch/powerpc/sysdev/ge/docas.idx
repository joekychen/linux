f | ge_pic.c | s | 6.7K | 204 | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1332381310 |  | Merge branch 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/benh/powerpc  Pull powerpc merge from Benjamin Herrenschmidt:  "Here's the powerpc batch for this merge window.  It is going to be a   bit more nasty than usual as in touching things outside of   arch/powerpc mostly due to the big iSeriesectomy :-) We finally got   rid of the bugger (legacy iSeries support) which was a PITA to   maintain and that nobody really used anymore.    Here are some of the highlights:     - Legacy iSeries is gone.  Thanks Stephen ! There's still some bits      and pieces remaining if you do a grep -ir series arch/powerpc but      they are harmless and will be removed in the next few weeks      hopefully.     - The 'fadump' functionality (Firmware Assisted Dump) replaces the      previous (equivalent) "pHyp assisted dump"...  it's a rewrite of a      mechanism to get the hypervisor to do crash dumps on pSeries, the      new implementation hopefully being much more reliable.  Thanks      Mahesh Salgaonkar.     - The "EEH" code (pSeries PCI error handling & recovery) got a big      spring cleaning, motivated by the need to be able to implement a      new backend for it on top of some new different type of firwmare.       The work isn't complete yet, but a good chunk of the cleanups is      there.  Note that this adds a field to struct device_node which is      not very nice and which Grant objects to.  I will have a patch soon      that moves that to a powerpc private data structure (hopefully      before rc1) and we'll improve things further later on (hopefully      getting rid of the need for that pointer completely).  Thanks Gavin      Shan.     - I dug into our exception & interrupt handling code to improve the      way we do lazy interrupt handling (and make it work properly with      "edge" triggered interrupt sources), and while at it found & fixed      a wagon of issues in those areas, including adding support for page      fault retry & fatal signals on page faults.     - Your usual random batch of small fixes & updates, including a bunch      of new embedded boards, both Freescale and APM based ones, etc..."  I fixed up some conflicts with the generalized irq-domain changes from Grant Likely, hopefully correctly.  * 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/benh/powerpc: (141 commits)   powerpc/ps3: Do not adjust the wrapper load address   powerpc: Remove the rest of the legacy iSeries include files   powerpc: Remove the remaining CONFIG_PPC_ISERIES pieces   init: Remove CONFIG_PPC_ISERIES   powerpc: Remove FW_FEATURE ISERIES from arch code   tty/hvc_vio: FW_FEATURE_ISERIES is no longer selectable   powerpc/spufs: Fix double unlocks   powerpc/5200: convert mpc5200 to use of_platform_populate()   powerpc/mpc5200: add options to mpc5200_defconfig   powerpc/mpc52xx: add a4m072 board support   powerpc/mpc5200: update mpc5200_defconfig to fit for charon board   Documentation/powerpc/mpc52xx.txt: Checkpatch cleanup   powerpc/44x: Add additional device support for APM821xx SoC and Bluestone board   powerpc/44x: Add support PCI-E for APM821xx SoC and Bluestone board   MAINTAINERS: Update PowerPC 4xx tree   powerpc/44x: The bug fixed support for APM821xx SoC and Bluestone board   powerpc: document the FSL MPIC message register binding   powerpc: add support for MPIC message register API   powerpc/fsl: Added aliased MSIIR register address to MSI node in dts   powerpc/85xx: mpc8548cds - add 36-bit dts   ...
