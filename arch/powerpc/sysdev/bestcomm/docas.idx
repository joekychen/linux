The BestComm engine is a microcode-controlled / tasks-based DMA used by several of the onchip devices.  Setting up the tasks / memory allocation and all common low level functions are handled by this patch. The specifics details of each tasks and their microcode are split-out in separate patches.  This is not the official API, but a much cleaner one. (hopefully)  Signed-off-by: Sylvain Munaut <tnt@246tNt.com> Signed-off-by: Grant Likely <grant.likely@secretlab.ca>
