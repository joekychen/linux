When the DIU is enabled, the bulk of the local bus is disabled, preventing access to memory-mapped devices like NOR flash and the pixis FPGA.  Therefore, if the DIU is going to be enabled, then memory-mapped devices on the localbus, like NOR flash, need to be disabled.  This also means that the localbus is not a 'simple-bus' any more, so remove that string from the compatible node.
