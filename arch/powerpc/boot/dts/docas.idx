Back in the FSL bsp it was set to 50Mhz and working. However the driver divided the SoC freq. only by 2. According to the TRM the platform clock (which the manual refers in its formula) is the system clock divided by two. So in the end it has to divide by 4 and this is what the fsl-spi driver in tree is doing. Since then the flash is not wokring I guess.

As the driver stands today, it assumes that all EMACs have 4 IAHT and GAHT 32-bit registers, starting at offset 0x30 from the register base, with only 16-bits of each used for a total of 64 match slots.  The 405EX(r) and 460EX now use the EMAC4SYNC core rather than the EMAC4 core. This core has 8 IAHT and GAHT registers, starting at offset 0x80 from the register base, with ALL 32-bits of each used for a total of 256 match slots.  This adds a new compatible device tree entry "emac4sync" and a new, related feature flag "EMAC_FTR_EMAC4SYNC" along with a series of macros and inlines which supply the appropriate parameterized value based on the presence or absence of the EMAC4SYNC feature.  The code has further been reworked where appropriate to use those macros and inlines.  In addition, the register size passed to ioremap is now taken from the device tree:  	c4 for EMAC4SYNC cores 	74 for EMAC4 cores 	70 for EMAC cores  rather than sizeof (emac_regs).  Finally, the device trees have been updated with the appropriate compatible entries and resource sizes.  This has been tested on an AMCC Haleakala board such that: 1) inbound ICMP requests to 'haleakala.local' via MDNS from both Mac OS X 10.4.11 and Ubuntu 8.04 systems as well as 2) outbound ICMP requests from 'haleakala.local' to those same systems in the '.local' domain via MDNS now work.

This is potentially confusing to people new to the dts format attempting to figure it out.  So, this patch converts all the as-yet unconverted dts v0 files and converts them to v1.  They're mechanically-converted, and not hand tweaked so in some cases they're not 100% in keeping with usual v1 style, but the convertor program does have some heuristics so the discrepancies aren't too bad.  I have checked that this patch produces no changes to the resulting dtb binaries.

f | holly.dts | g | 4.8K |  | David Gibson | david@gibson.dropbear.id.au | 1222745105 |  | powerpc: Fix PCI in Holly device tree  The PCI bridge on the Holly board is incorrectly represented in the device tree.  The current device tree node for the PCI bridge sits under the tsi-bridge node.  That's not obviously wrong, but the PCI bridge translates some PCI spaces into CPU address ranges which were not translated by the "ranges" property in tsi-bridge node.  We used to get away with this problem because the PCI bridge discovery code was also buggy, assuming incorrectly that PCI host bridge nodes were always directly under the root bus and treating the translated addresses as raw CPU addresses, rather than parent bus addresses. This has since been fixed, thus breaking Holly.  This could be fixed by adding extra translations to the tsi-bridge node, but this patch instead moves the Holly PCI bridge out of the tsi-bridge node to the root bus.  This makes the tsi-bridge node represent only the built-in IO devices in the bridge, with a more-or-less contiguous address range.  This is the same convention used on Freescale SoC chips, where the "soc" node represents only the IMMR region, and the PCI and other bus bridges are separate nodes under the root bus.

This is potentially confusing to people new to the dts format attempting to figure it out.  So, this patch converts all the as-yet unconverted dts v0 files and converts them to v1.  They're mechanically-converted, and not hand tweaked so in some cases they're not 100% in keeping with usual v1 style, but the convertor program does have some heuristics so the discrepancies aren't too bad.  I have checked that this patch produces no changes to the resulting dtb binaries.

f | obs600.dts | g | 7.9K |  | Benjamin Herrenschmidt | benh@kernel.crashing.org | 1323314572 |  | powerpc: Add support for OpenBlockS 600  So I've had one of these for a while and it looks like the vendor never bothered submitting the support upstream.  This adds it using ppc40x_simple and provides a device-tree.  There are some changes to the boot wrapper because the way u-boot works on this thing, it seems to expect a multipart image with the kernel, initrd and dtb in it.  The USB support is missing as it needs the yet unmerged driver for the DWC OTG part and the GPIOs may need further definition in the dts.
