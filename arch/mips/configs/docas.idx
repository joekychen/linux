The userspace has to manually create a cgroup and add a task to   the 'tasks' file.  This patch removes the ns_cgroup as suggested in the following thread:  https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2009-June/018616.html  The 'cgroup_clone' function is removed because it is no longer used.  This is a userspace-visible change.  Commit 45531757b45c ("cgroup: notify ns_cgroup deprecated") (merged into 2.6.27) caused the kernel to emit a printk warning users that the feature is planned for removal.  Since that time we have heard from XXX users who were affected by this.  Signed-off-by: Daniel Lezcano <daniel.lezcano@free.fr> Signed-off-by: Serge E. Hallyn <serge.hallyn@canonical.com> Cc: Eric W.

Whoever wants to change the default spinlock inlining behavior and uninline the spinlocks for some weird reason, such as spinlock debugging, paravirt etc. can now all just select UNINLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK  Original discussion at: https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/21/357  Suggested-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org> Signed-off-by: Raghavendra K T <raghavendra.kt@linux.vnet.ibm.com> Cc: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org> Cc: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org> Cc: Chris Metcalf <cmetcalf@tilera.com> Cc: Chris Zankel <chris@zankel.net> Cc: linux-mips@linux-mips.org Link: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20120322095502.30866.75756.sendpatchset@codeblue [ tidied up the changelog a bit ] Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@kernel.org>
f | ar7_defconfig | g | 3.7K |  | David Rientjes | rientjes@google.com | 1295571725 |  | kconfig: rename CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_EXPERT  The meaning of CONFIG_EMBEDDED has long since been obsoleted; the option is used to configure any non-standard kernel with a much larger scope than only small devices.  This patch renames the option to CONFIG_EXPERT in init/Kconfig and fixes references to the option throughout the kernel.  A new CONFIG_EMBEDDED option is added that automatically selects CONFIG_EXPERT when enabled and can be used in the future to isolate options that should only be considered for embedded systems (RISC architectures, SLOB, etc).  Calling the option "EXPERT" more accurately represents its intention: only expert users who understand the impact of the configuration changes they are making should enable it.
