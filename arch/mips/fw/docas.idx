The major part   is the splitting of the EISA and onboard ISA of the RM200, which   makes the EISA bus on the RM200 look like on other RMs. - 64bit kernel support - system type detection is now common for big and little endian - moved sniprom code to arch/mips/fw - added call_o32 function to arch/mips/fw/lib, which uses a private   stack for calling prom functions - fix problem with ISA interrupts, which makes using PIT clockevent   possible  Signed-off-by: Thomas Bogendoerfer <tsbogend@alpha.franken.de> Signed-off-by: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org>
