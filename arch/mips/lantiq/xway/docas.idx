The following 2 patches will convert the drivers to OF.

The last change to the series was before the weekend the   removal of an SPI patch which Grant - even though previously acked by   himself - appeared to raise objections.  So I removed it until the   situation is clarified.  Other than that all the patches have the acks   from their respective maintainers, all MIPS and x86 defconfigs are   building fine and I'm not aware of any problems introduced by this   series.    Among the key features for this patch series is a sizable patchset for   Lantiq which among other things introduces support for Lantiq's   flagship product, the FALCON SOC.  It also means that the opensource   developers behind this patchset have overtaken Lantiq's competing   inhouse development team that was working behind closed doors.    Less noteworthy the ath79 patchset which adds support for a few more   chip variants, cleanups and fixes.  Finally the usual dose of tweaking   of generic code."  Fix up trivial conflicts in arch/mips/lantiq/xway/gpio_{ebu,stp}.c where printk spelling fixes clashed with file move and eventual removal of the printk.  * 'upstream' of git://git.linux-mips.org/pub/scm/ralf/upstream-linus: (81 commits)   MIPS: lantiq: remove orphaned code   MIPS: Remove all -Wall and almost all -Werror usage from arch/mips.
