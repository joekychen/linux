The code      strlen(buf+1)  will be two bytes less than      strlen(buf)+1  The +1 is in this code to reserve space for an additional space character.  [ralf@linux-mips.org: Thomas' original patch fixed the issue only for  Yosemite but the same bug exists also in Emma.]  Signed-off-by: Thomas Jarosch <thomas.jarosch@intra2net.com> Patchwork: https://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/2861/ Signed-off-by: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org>

While at it zap some only too obvious comments and as per Shinya's suggestion, add a copyright header to extable.c.
