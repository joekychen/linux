All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

Among the key features for this patch series is a sizable patchset for   Lantiq which among other things introduces support for Lantiq's   flagship product, the FALCON SOC.  It also means that the opensource   developers behind this patchset have overtaken Lantiq's competing   inhouse development team that was working behind closed doors.    Less noteworthy the ath79 patchset which adds support for a few more   chip variants, cleanups and fixes.  Finally the usual dose of tweaking   of generic code."  Fix up trivial conflicts in arch/mips/lantiq/xway/gpio_{ebu,stp}.c where printk spelling fixes clashed with file move and eventual removal of the printk.  * 'upstream' of git://git.linux-mips.org/pub/scm/ralf/upstream-linus: (81 commits)   MIPS: lantiq: remove orphaned code   MIPS: Remove all -Wall and almost all -Werror usage from arch/mips.

It gets rid of:   - the net/tr.c which the drivers depended on   - the drivers/net component   - the Kbuild infrastructure around it   - any tokenring related CONFIG_ settings in any defconfigs   - the tokenring headers in the include/linux dir   - the firmware associated with the tokenring drivers.   - any associated token ring documentation.
