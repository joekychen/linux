Since a clocksource change post 3.2-rc1, tasks on my DB1500 board hang after random amounts of time (from a few minutes to a few hours), regardless of load.  Debugging showed that the compare-match register value is a few seconds lower than the current counter value.  The minimum value of 8 was initialy determined by a trial-and-error approach.  Currently it is sufficient for all Alchemys (without PCI apparently), independent of CPU clock;  only the DB1500 and DB1550 boards experience these timer-related tasks hangs now.  This patch increases the minimum timeout by 1 (to 9 counter ticks) which seems sufficient since the systems are still working perfectly fine after over 24 hours.
