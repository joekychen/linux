f | platform.h | s | 569B | 17 | Manuel Lauss | manuel.lauss@googlemail.com | 1267271623 |  | MIPS: Alchemy: use 36bit addresses for PCMCIA resources.  On Alchemy the PCMCIA area lies at the end of the chips 36bit system bus area.  Currently, addresses at the far end of the 32bit area are assumed to belong to the PCMCIA area and fixed up to the real 36bit address before being passed to ioremap().  A previous commit enabled 64 bit physical size for the resource datatype on Alchemy and this allows to use the correct 36bit addresses when registering the PCMCIA sockets.  This patch removes the 32-to-36bit address fixup and registers the Alchemy demo board pcmcia socket with the correct 36bit physical addresses.  Tested on DB1200, with a CF card (ide-cs driver) and a 3c589 PCMCIA ethernet card.
