f | Makefile | g | 205B |  | Atsushi Nemoto | anemo@mba.ocn.ne.jp | 1172531165 |  | [MIPS] Kill redundant EXTRA_AFLAGS  Many Makefiles in arch/mips have EXTRA_AFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) line.  This is redundant while AFLAGS contains $(cflags-y) and any options only listed in CFLAGS (not in cflags-y) should be unnecessary for asm sources.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
