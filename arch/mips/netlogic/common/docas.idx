f | Makefile | g | 105B |  | Jayachandran C | jayachandranc@netlogicmicro.com | 1323295496 |  | MIPS: Netlogic: Merge some of XLR/XLP wakup code  Create a common NMI and reset handler in smpboot.S and use this for both XLR and XLP.  In the earlier code, the woken up CPUs would busy wait until released, switch this to wakeup by NMI.  The initial wakeup code or XLR and XLP are differ since they are started from different bootloaders (XLP from u-boot and XLR from netlogic bootloader). But in both platforms the woken up CPUs wait and are released by sending an NMI.  Add support for starting XLR and XLP in 1/2/4 threads per core.
