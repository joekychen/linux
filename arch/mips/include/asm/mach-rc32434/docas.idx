f | gpio.h | s | 2.3K | 74 | Phil Sutter | n0-1@freewrt.org | 1236654612 |  | Input: add driver for S1 button of rb532  Mikrotik's Routerboard 532 has two builtin buttons, from which one triggers a hardware reset. The other one is accessible through GPIO pin 1. Sadly, this pin is being multiplexed with UART0 input, so enabling it as interrupt source (as implied by the gpio-keys driver) is not possible unless UART0 has been turned off. The later one though is a rather bad idea as the Routerboard is an embedded device with only a single serial port, so it's almost always used as serial console device.  This patch adds a driver based on INPUT_POLLDEV, which disables the UART and reconfigures GPIO pin 1 temporarily while reading the button state.  This procedure works fine and has been tested as part of another, unpublished driver for this device.  Signed-off-by: Phil Sutter <n0-1@freewrt.org> Signed-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dtor@mail.ru>

f | irq.h | s | 1.0K | 27 | Phil Sutter | n0-1@freewrt.org | 1233351179 |  | MIPS: RB532: Add set_type() function to IRQ struct.  Interrupt Group 4 mapps the GPIO pins enabled as interrupt sources; add defines to make this clear when addressing them later in code.  The mapped GPIOs support triggering on either level high or low. To achieve this, the set_type() function calls rb532_gpio_set_ilevel() for interrupts of the above mentioned group.  As there is no way to alter the triggering characteristics of the other interrupts, accept level triggering on status high only. (This is just a guess; but as the system boots fine and interrupt-driven devices (e.g. serial console) work with no implications, it seems to be right.)  To clear a GPIO mapped IRQ, the source has to be cleared (i.e., the interrupt status bit of the corresponding GPIO pin). This is done inside rb532_disable_irq().  After applying these changes I could undo most of my former "fixes" to pata-rb532-cf. Particularly all interrupt handling can be done generically via set_irq_type() as it was before.
