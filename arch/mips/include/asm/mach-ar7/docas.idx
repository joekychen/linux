This SoC is almost completely identical to AR7 except on a few points: - a second bank of gpios is available - vlynq0 on titan is vlynq1 on ar7 - different PHY addresses for cpmac0  This SoC can be found on commercial products like the Linksys WRTP54G  Original patch by Xin with improvments by Florian.

In order to have the correct loops per jiffies settings, initialize clocks right before setting mips_hpt_frequency. As a side effect, we can no longer use msleep in clocks.c which requires other parts of the kernel to be initialized, so replace these with mdelay.
