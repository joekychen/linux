This series will add support for the XWAY family.  The series allows booting a minimal system using a initramfs or NOR. Missing drivers and support for Amazon and GPON family will be provided in a later series.

Previously we used ltq_gpio_request() to set pinmuxing. This is now obselete and we can hence drop the function.  Additionally we remove gpio_to_irq() from the gpio driver and move it to a header file.
