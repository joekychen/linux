Previously it was unconditionally used on all Sibyte family SOCs.  The M3 bug has to be handled in the TLB exception handler which is extremly performance sensitive, so this modification is expected to deliver around 2-3% performance improvment.  This is important as required changes to the M3 workaround will make it more costly.  Signed-off-by: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org>
