f | README-SRC | g | 554B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
