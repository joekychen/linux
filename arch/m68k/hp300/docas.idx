I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
f | config.c | s | 6.5K | 233 | Geert Uytterhoeven | geert@linux-m68k.org | 1323543168 |  | m68k/hp300: Export hp300_ledstate  The accidental loss of CONFIG_DIO in commit 0e152d80507b75c00aac60f2ffc586360687cd52 ("m68k: reorganize Kconfig options to improve mmu/non-mmu selections") exposed a missing symbol export in m68k allmodconfig.  If CONFIG_HP300=y but CONFIG_HPLANCE (which is bool, and depends on CONFIG_DIO) is not set, and CONFIG_MVME147=y and CONFIG_MVME147_NET=m, 7990.c is compiled as a module, giving:  ERROR: "ledstate" [drivers/net/ethernet/amd/7990.ko] undefined!  Add the missing export, and rename ledstate to hp300_ledstate while we're at it, as it's a too generic name.  Signed-off-by: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>
