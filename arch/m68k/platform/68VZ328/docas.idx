f | Makefile | g | 248B |  | Greg Ungerer | gerg@uclinux.org | 1334553064 |  | m68knommu: remove the unused bootlogo.h processing for 68EZ328 and 68VZ328  The 68EZ328 and 68VZ328 platforms currently try to process their bootlogo.h to make it clean to include in asm files. This is no longer used, the bootlogo.h file is now included only in C code, so remove all the processing code in the 68EZ328 and 68VZ328 Makefiles.  Signed-off-by: Greg Ungerer <gerg@uclinux.org>
f | bootlogo.h | s | 231K | 3204 | Greg Ungerer | gerg@uclinux.org | 1334553064 |  | m68knommu: move and fix the 68VZ328 platform bootlogo.h  The 68EZ328/bootlogo.h is not actually used in the 68EZ328 platform code at all. It is used by the 68VZ328 platform code though, so move it to be with the rest of the 68VZ328 platform code.  Commit c0e0c89c089f4bd66dbbd1a44da90abe74fe3f02 ("fix broken boot logo inclusion") modified the bootlogo code to not be included in asm code. Modify 68VZ328/bootlogo.h so that the bootlogo bit map is named correctly for direct use in the C code.  Signed-off-by: Greg Ungerer <gerg@uclinux.org>
