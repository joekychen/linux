No need to re-set them on each allocation site.  pti driver sets something different to what it passes to alloc_tty_driver. It is not a bug, since we don't use the lines parameter in any way. Anyway this is fixed, and now we do the right thing.

Note that various drivers got the return value from ->make_request and returned non-zero values for errors.
