In asm-offsets.h there are defines for signal constants, so they can be used in assembler files.  Unfortunately the existing defines use a 1:1 mapping for the macro names which results in name space conflicts if the header file would also be used in C files. So rename the created defines and add an "L" prefix to each one since that has already been done for the SIGTRAP define in entry_mm.
