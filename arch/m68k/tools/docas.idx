Given that the author used an ß at all in a source file     indicates that the real name has in fact a 'ß' and not an 'ss',     which is commonly used as a substitute for 'ß' when limited to     7bit.)    * Correct town names (Goettingen -> Göttingen)    * Update Eberhard Mönkeberg's address (http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/8/313)  Signed-off-by: Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@gmx.de> Signed-off-by: Adrian Bunk <bunk@kernel.org>
