This patch adds declaration of io_offset.

f | iomap.c | s | 428B | 20 | Michael S. Tsirkin | mst@redhat.com | 1322507590 |  | microblaze: switch to GENERIC_PCI_IOMAP  microblaze copied pci_iomap from generic code, probably to avoid pulling the rest of iomap.c in.  Since that's in a separate file now, we can reuse the common implementation.  The only difference is handling of nocache flag, that turns out to be done correctly by the generic code since arch/microblaze/include/asm/io.h defines ioremap_nocache same as ioremap.

The include of linux/of_address.h was removed in microblaze prom.h in commit "of/address: Clean up function declarations" (sha1 id 22ae782f8), but not fixed in some callers.  This patch fixes them up.  Signed-off-by: Grant Likely <grant.likely@secretlab.ca> Tested-by: Michal Simek <monstr@monstr.eu>
