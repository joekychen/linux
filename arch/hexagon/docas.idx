d | include |  | 1 items |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@linux-foundation.org | 1337901450 |  | Merge branch 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm  Pull KVM changes from Avi Kivity:  "Changes include additional instruction emulation, page-crossing MMIO,   faster dirty logging, preventing the watchdog from killing a stopped   guest, module autoload, a new MSI ABI, and some minor optimizations   and fixes.  Outside x86 we have a small s390 and a very large ppc   update.    Regarding the new (for kvm) rebaseless workflow, some of the patches   that were merged before we switch trees had to be rebased, while   others are true pulls.  In either case the signoffs should be correct   now."  Fix up trivial conflicts in Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_segment.S and arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_para.h.  I suspect the kvm_para.h resolution ends up doing the "do I have cpuid" check effectively twice (it was done differently in two different commits), but better safe than sorry ;)  * 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm: (125 commits)   KVM: make asm-generic/kvm_para.h have an ifdef __KERNEL__ block   KVM: s390: onereg for timer related registers   KVM: s390: epoch difference and TOD programmable field   KVM: s390: KVM_GET/SET_ONEREG for s390   KVM: s390: add capability indicating COW support   KVM: Fix mmu_reload() clash with nested vmx event injection   KVM: MMU: Don't use RCU for lockless shadow walking   KVM: VMX: Optimize %ds, %es reload   KVM: VMX: Fix %ds/%es clobber   KVM: x86 emulator: convert bsf/bsr instructions to emulate_2op_SrcV_nobyte()   KVM: VMX: unlike vmcs on fail path   KVM: PPC: Emulator: clean up SPR reads and writes   KVM: PPC: Emulator: clean up instruction parsing   kvm/powerpc: Add new ioctl to retreive server MMU infos   kvm/book3s: Make kernel emulated H_PUT_TCE available for "PR" KVM   KVM: PPC: bookehv: Fix r8/r13 storing in level exception handler   KVM: PPC: Book3S: Enable IRQs during exit handling   KVM: PPC: Fix PR KVM on POWER7 bare metal   KVM: PPC: Fix stbux emulation   KVM: PPC: bookehv: Use lwz/stw instead of PPC_LL/PPC_STL for 32-bit fields   ...
d | kernel |  | 29 items |  | Al Viro | viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk | 1338569932 |  | new helper: signal_delivered()  Does block_sigmask() + tracehook_signal_handler();  called when sigframe has been successfully built.  All architectures converted to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).  I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number + siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one, signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() - take one).

These changes reduce the mmap_sem hold time, which is crucial during OOM killer invocation.  Port these changes to hexagon.
