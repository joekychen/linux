Accordingly, we need to use an "ld4s" rather than "ld4u" to load and sign-extend for get_user().  This fixes glibc bug 14238 (see http://sourceware.org/bugzilla), introduced during the 3.5 merge window.  Signed-off-by: Chris Metcalf <cmetcalf@tilera.com>

In addition, the code was only applicable to the udn (user dynamic network).  On tilegx there is a second user network that is available (the "idn"), and there is support for having I/O shims deliver user-level interrupts to applications ("ipi") which functions in a very similar way to the inter-core permissions used for udn/idn. So this change also generalizes the code from supporting just the udn to supports udn/idn/ipi on tilegx.  By default we now use /dev/hardwall/{udn,idn,ipi} with separate minor numbers for the three devices.  Signed-off-by: Chris Metcalf <cmetcalf@tilera.com>
