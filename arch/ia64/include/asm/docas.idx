For the hypervisor to take advantage of the MWAIT support it needs to extract from the ACPI _CST the register address. But the hypervisor does not have the support to parse DSDT so it relies on the initial domain (dom0) to parse the ACPI Power Management information and push it up to the hypervisor. The pushing of the data is done by the processor_harveset_xen module which parses the information that the ACPI parser has graciously exposed in 'struct acpi_processor'.  For the ACPI parser to also expose the Cx states for MWAIT, we need to expose the MWAIT capability (leaf 1). Furthermore we also need to expose the MWAIT_LEAF capability (leaf 5) for cstate.c to properly function.  The hypervisor could expose these flags when it traps the XEN_EMULATE_PREFIX operations, but it can't do it since it needs to be backwards compatible. Instead we choose to use the native CPUID to figure out if the MWAIT capability exists and use the XEN_SET_PDC query hypercall to figure out if the hypervisor wants us to expose the MWAIT_LEAF capability or not.  Note: The XEN_SET_PDC query was implemented in c/s 23783: "ACPI: add _PDC input override mechanism".  With this in place, instead of  C3 ACPI IOPORT 415 we get now  C3:ACPI FFH INTEL MWAIT 0x20  Note: The cpu_idle which would be calling the mwait variants for idling never gets set b/c we set the default pm_idle to be the hypercall variant.

Therefore, in creating pt_regs at ia64_mca_modify_original_stack(), cr_{iip,ipsr,ifs} should be derived from pmsa_{iip,ipsr,ifs}. But current code copies pmsa_{xip,xpsr,xfs} to cr_{iip,ipsr,ifs} when PSR.ic is 0.  finish_pt_regs(struct pt_regs *regs, const pal_min_state_area_t *ms,                 unsigned long *nat) { (snip)         if (ia64_psr(regs)->ic) {                 regs->cr_iip = ms->pmsa_iip;                 regs->cr_ipsr = ms->pmsa_ipsr;                 regs->cr_ifs = ms->pmsa_ifs;         } else {                 regs->cr_iip = ms->pmsa_xip;                 regs->cr_ipsr = ms->pmsa_xpsr;                 regs->cr_ifs = ms->pmsa_xfs;         }  It's ok when PSR.ic is not 0. But when PSR.ic is 0, this could be a problem when we investigate kernel as the value of regs->cr_iip does not point to where INIT really interrupted.  At first I tried to change finish_pt_regs() so that it uses always pmsa_{iip,ipsr,ifs} for cr_{iip,ipsr,ifs}, but Keith Owens pointed out it could cause another problem if I change it.  >The only problem I can think of is an MCA/INIT >arriving while code like SAVE_MIN or SAVE_REST is executing.  Back >tracing at that point using pmsa_iip is going to be a problem, you have >no idea what state the registers or stack are in.  I confirmed he was right, so I decided to keep it as-is and to save pmsa_{iip,ipsr,ifs} to ia64_sal_os_state for debugging.  An attached patch is just adding new members into ia64_sal_os_state to save pmsa_{iip,ipsr,ifs}.

Migrating piecemeal is too painful; this giant patch fixes all compilation warnings and errors that come as a result of switching to use int-ll64.h.  Note that userspace will still see __u64 defined as unsigned long.  This is important as it affects C++ name mangling.

We cannot use CONFIG_64BIT for this in headers that are included from user space because CONFIG symbols are not available there. We also cannot do it inside of asm/types.h because some headers need the word size but cannot include types.h.  The solution is to introduce a new header <asm/bitsperlong.h> that defines both __BITS_PER_LONG for user space and BITS_PER_LONG for usage in the kernel.

f | ptrace.h | s | 12K | 324 | Eric Paris | eparis@redhat.com | 1326835016 |  | Audit: push audit success and retcode into arch ptrace.h  The audit system previously expected arches calling to audit_syscall_exit to supply as arguments if the syscall was a success and what the return code was. Audit also provides a helper AUDITSC_RESULT which was supposed to simplify things by converting from negative retcodes to an audit internal magic value stating success or failure.  This helper was wrong and could indicate that a valid pointer returned to userspace was a failed syscall.  The fix is to fix the layering foolishness.  We now pass audit_syscall_exit a struct pt_reg and it in turns calls back into arch code to collect the return value and to determine if the syscall was a success or failure.  We also define a generic is_syscall_success() macro which determines success/failure based on if the value is < -MAX_ERRNO.  This works for arches like x86 which do not use a separate mechanism to indicate syscall failure.  We make both the is_syscall_success() and regs_return_value() static inlines instead of macros.  The reason is because the audit function must take a void* for the regs.  (uml calls theirs struct uml_pt_regs instead of just struct pt_regs so audit_syscall_exit can't take a struct pt_regs).  Since the audit function takes a void* we need to use static inlines to cast it back to the arch correct structure to dereference it.  The other major change is that on some arches, like ia64, MIPS and ppc, we change regs_return_value() to give us the negative value on syscall failure. THE only other user of this macro, kretprobe_example.c, won't notice and it makes the value signed consistently for the audit functions across all archs.  In arch/sh/kernel/ptrace_64.c I see that we were using regs[9] in the old audit code as the return value.  But the ptrace_64.h code defined the macro regs_return_value() as regs[3].  I have no idea which one is correct, but this patch now uses the regs_return_value() function, so it now uses regs[3].  For powerpc we previously used regs->result but now use the regs_return_value() function which uses regs->gprs[3].  regs->gprs[3] is always positive so the regs_return_value(), much like ia64 makes it negative before calling the audit code when appropriate.

f | termbits.h | s | 4.7K | 192 | hyc@symas.com | hyc@symas.com | 1281473259 |  | tty: Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE  This patch is against the 2.6.34 source.  Paraphrased from the 1989 BSD patch by David Borman @ cray.com:       These are the changes needed for the kernel to support      LINEMODE in the server.       There is a new bit in the termios local flag word, EXTPROC.      When this bit is set, several aspects of the terminal driver      are disabled.  Input line editing, character echo, and mapping      of signals are all disabled.  This allows the telnetd to turn      off these functions when in linemode, but still keep track of      what state the user wants the terminal to be in.       New ioctl:          TIOCSIG         Generate a signal to processes in the                          current process group of the pty.       There is a new mode for packet driver, the TIOCPKT_IOCTL bit.      When packet mode is turned on in the pty, and the EXTPROC bit      is set, then whenever the state of the pty is changed, the      next read on the master side of the pty will have the TIOCPKT_IOCTL      bit set.  This allows the process on the server side of the pty      to know when the state of the terminal has changed; it can then      issue the appropriate ioctl to retrieve the new state.  Since the original BSD patches accompanied the source code for telnet I've left that reference here, but obviously the feature is useful for any remote terminal protocol, including ssh.  The corresponding feature has existed in the BSD tty driver since 1989.

But the ia64 implementation was subtly broken.  Gcc does not know that register "r8" will be updated by the fault handler if the cmpxchg instruction takes an exception.  So it feels safe in letting the initialization of r8 slide to after the cmpxchg.  Result: we always return 0 whether the user address faulted or not.  Fix by moving the initialization of r8 into the __asm__ code so gcc won't move it.

It should also address the various misconceptions and confusions that surround jump labels.  Typical usage scenarios:          #include <linux/static_key.h>          struct static_key key = STATIC_KEY_INIT_TRUE;          if (static_key_false(&key))                 do unlikely code         else                 do likely code  Or:          if (static_key_true(&key))                 do likely code         else                 do unlikely code  The static key is modified via:          static_key_slow_inc(&key);         ...         static_key_slow_dec(&key);  The 'slow' prefix makes it abundantly clear that this is an expensive operation.  I've updated all in-kernel code to use this everywhere. Note that I (intentionally) have not pushed through the rename blindly through to the lowest levels: the actual jump-label patching arch facility should be named like that, so we want to decouple jump labels from the static-key facility a bit.  On non-jump-label enabled architectures static keys default to likely()/unlikely() branches.

f | dmi.h | s | 239B | 9 | Tejun Heo | tj@kernel.org | 1269954152 |  | include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h  percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.  percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is used as the basis of conversion.    http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py  The script does the followings.  * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that   only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,   gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.  * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include   blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms   to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains   core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -   alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there   doesn't seem to be any matching order.  * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly   because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out   an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the   file.  The conversion was done in the following steps.  1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly    over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h    and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400    files.  2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,    some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or    embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added    inclusions to around 150 files.  3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits    from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.  4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.    e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab    APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.  5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically    editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h    files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h    inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually    wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each    slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as    necessary.  6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.  7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures    were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my    distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few    more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things    build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).     * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.    * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig    * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig    * ia64 SMP allmodconfig    * s390 SMP allmodconfig    * alpha SMP allmodconfig    * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig  8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as    a separate patch and serve as bisection point.  Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step 6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch. If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of the specific arch.

Basically, the TLB can be loaded with "large" pages that cover the whole virtual space (well, sort-of, half of it actually) represented by a PTE page, and which contain an "indirect" bit indicating that this TLB entry RPN points to an array of PTEs from which the TLB can then create direct entries. Thus, in order to invalidate those when PTE pages are deleted, we need the virtual address to pass to tlbilx or tlbivax instructions.  The old trick of sticking it somewhere in the PTE page struct page sucks too much, the address is almost readily available in all call sites and almost everybody implemets these as macros, so we may as well add the argument everywhere. I added it to the pmd and pud variants for consistency.
