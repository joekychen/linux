I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

This bites ia64's check-segrel.lds. The bug is easy to avoid.  Signed-off-by: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: Tony Luck <tony.luck@intel.com>
f | unwcheck.py | s | 1.7K | 57 | Don Zickus | dzickus@redhat.com | 1265117636 |  | scripts: change scripts to use system python instead of env  Just a small change to a couple of scripts to go from   #!/usr/bin/env python  to   #!/usr/bin/python  This shouldn't effect anyone, unless they don't install python there.  In preparation for python3, Fedora is doing a big push to change the scripts to use the system python.  This allows developers to put the python3 in their path without fear of breaking existing scripts.  Now I am pretty sure anyone using python3 for testing purposes will probably not run any of the scripts I changed, but Fedora has this automated tool that checks for this stuff so I thought I would try to push it upstream.
