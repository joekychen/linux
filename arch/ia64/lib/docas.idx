It defines new machvec dig_vtd, hooks for IOMMU, DMAR table detection, cache line flush function, etc.  For a generic kernel with CONFIG_DMAR=y, if Intel IOMMU is detected, dig_vtd is used for machinve vector. Otherwise, kernel falls back to dig machine vector. Kernel parameter "machvec=dig" or "intel_iommu=off" can be used to force kernel to boot dig machine vector.
