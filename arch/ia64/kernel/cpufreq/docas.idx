f | acpi-cpufreq.c | s | 9.8K | 338 | Dominik Brodowski | linux@dominikbrodowski.net | 1304524257 |  | [CPUFREQ] use dynamic debug instead of custom infrastructure  With dynamic debug having gained the capability to report debug messages also during the boot process, it offers a far superior interface for debug messages than the custom cpufreq infrastructure. As a first step, remove the old cpufreq_debug_printk() function and replace it with a call to the generic pr_debug() function.  How can dynamic debug be used on cpufreq? You need a kernel which has CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG enabled.  To enabled debugging during runtime, mount debugfs and  $ echo -n 'module cpufreq +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control  for debugging the complete "cpufreq" module. To achieve the same goal during boot, append  	ddebug_query="module cpufreq +p"  as a boot parameter to the kernel of your choice.

This driver is based on ACPI, and uses the ACPI processor driver interface to find out the P-state support information for the processor. This driver plugs into generic cpufreq infrastructure.  Once this driver is loaded successfully, ondemand/userspace governor can be used to change the CPU frequency dynamically based on load or on request from userspace process.
