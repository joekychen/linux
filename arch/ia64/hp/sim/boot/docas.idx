I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
f | boot_head.S | g | 3.9K |  | David Mosberger-Tang | dmosberger@gmail.com | 1187036762 |  | [IA64] make unwinder stop at last frame of the bootloader  Add a dummy nop at the end of _start() to maintain the invariant that the return-pointer (rp) always point to the calling function.  This makes unwinding stop at the last frame, as it should.  Signed-off-by: David Mosberger-Tang <dmosberger@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Tony Luck <tony.luck@intel.com>

To do this we need to move the copy_page() functions out of lib.a and into built-in.o and add the EXPORT_SYMBOL().

That makes it possible to use the <linux/sections.h> instead of own declarations.  Also add __bss_stop because that symbol exists on other architectures.
