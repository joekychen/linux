(PTCs are the SN platform-specific method for doing a global TLB purge). This patch fixes deadlock recovery so that it works on both the old & new chipsets.

f | cache.c | s | 1.2K | 38 | Dean Nelson | dcn@sgi.com | 1151073769 |  | [PATCH] change gen_pool allocator to not touch managed memory  Modify the gen_pool allocator (lib/genalloc.c) to utilize a bitmap scheme instead of the buddy scheme.  The purpose of this change is to eliminate the touching of the actual memory being allocated.  Since the change modifies the interface, a change to the uncached allocator (arch/ia64/kernel/uncached.c) is also required.  Both Andrey Volkov and Jes Sorenson have expressed a desire that the gen_pool allocator not write to the memory being managed.

We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
