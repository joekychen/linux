f | Kconfig | g | 345B |  | Henrik Rydberg | rydberg@euromail.se | 1340637900 |  | HID: Fix the generic Kconfig options  The generic HID driver is obviously not a special driver, so move it outside of the special drivers menu. Explain the usage and make the default follow the HID setting. This should simplify migration from older kernels. While at it, remove the redundant HID_SUPPORT option and modify the HID and USB_HID entries to better explain the bus structure.

f | hidp.h | s | 5.1K | 153 | Peter Hurley | peter@hurleysoftware.com | 1309459670 |  | Bluetooth: Fix hidp disconnect deadlocks and lost wakeup  Partial revert of commit aabf6f89. When the hidp session thread was converted from kernel_thread to kthread, the atomic/wakeups were replaced with kthread_stop. kthread_stop has blocking semantics which are inappropriate for the hidp session kthread. In addition, the kthread signals itself to terminate in hidp_process_hid_control() - it cannot do this with kthread_stop().  Lastly, a wakeup can be lost if the wakeup happens between checking for the loop exit condition and setting the current state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. (Without appropriate synchronization mechanisms, the task state should not be changed between the condition test and the yield - via schedule() - as this creates a race between the wakeup and resetting the state back to interruptible.)

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

This ought to simplify device handling moving forward.  Cc: Gustavo Padovan <gustavo@padovan.org> Signed-off-by: Henrik Rydberg <rydberg@euromail.se> Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>
