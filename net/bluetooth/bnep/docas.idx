In this case, the thread can't exit because it's waiting for the write lock, which is being held by bnep_del_connection() which is waiting for the thread to exit -- deadlock.  Use atomic_t/wake_up_process instead to signal to the thread to exit.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
