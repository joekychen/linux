In this case, the thread can't exit because it's waiting for the write lock, which is being held by cmtp_del_connection() which is waiting for the thread to exit -- deadlock.  Revert cmtp_reset_ctr to its original behavior: non-blocking signalling for the session to terminate.  Signed-off-by: Peter Hurley <peter@hurleysoftware.com> Signed-off-by: Gustavo F.

f | Makefile | g | 118B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
