f | Kconfig | g | 459B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

The tty has the index set in the initial open. This is done in get_tty_driver. And it can be only in interval <0,driver->num).  So remove the tests which check exactly this interval. Some are left untouched as they check against the current backing device count. (Leaving apart that the check is racy in most of the cases.)
