It also corrects an error in Documentation/networking/l2tp.txt, where it referenced include/linux/if_ppp.h as the source of some definitions that are actually now defined in include/linux/if_pppol2tp.h.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
