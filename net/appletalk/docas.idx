Biederman | ebiederm@xmission.com | 1334971350 |  | net: Convert all sysctl registrations to register_net_sysctl  This results in code with less boiler plate that is a bit easier to read.  Additionally stops us from using compatibility code in the sysctl core, hastening the day when the compatibility code can be removed.  Signed-off-by: Eric W.

f | Makefile | g | 212B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

Given we're post 2.2, we could just -EACCES, but does anyone even care about Appletalk now ? I figure it's better to leave sleeping dogs lie, and just update the message.
