This resulted in sparse warnings due to __beXX data containing both NBO and HBO data.  The code has been restructured to do byte-swapping as the header is parsed instead of when the header is validated immediately after receipt.  Also moved extern declarations for the workqueue and memory pools to the private header file.  Signed-off-by: Tom Tucker <tom@ogc.us> Signed-off-by: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>
