This is not the case for ehca, for example, which is a OF driver, and makes dma_device point to a struct device embedded in a struct platform_device.  This will make the system crash when rds_rdma is loaded in a system with ehca, since it will try to access the bus member of a non-existent struct pci_dev.  The only reason rds_rdma uses the struct pci_dev is to get the NUMA node the device is attached to. Using dev_to_node for that is much better, since it won't assume which bus the infiniband is attached to.
