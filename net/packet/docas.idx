Early on this was an experimental facility that few people other than Alexey Kuznetsov played with.  Now it's a pretty fundamental thing and as people add more features to AF_PACKET sockets this config options creates ifdef spaghetti.  So kill it off.  Signed-off-by: David S.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
