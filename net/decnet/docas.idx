I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.

f | Kconfig | g | 1.6K |  | Thomas Graf | tgraf@suug.ch | 1165123299 |  | [NET]: Rethink mark field in struct flowi  Now that all protocols have been made aware of the mark field it can be moved out of the union thus simplyfing its usage.  The config options in the IPv4/IPv6/DECnet subsystems to enable respectively disable mark based routing only obfuscate the code with ifdefs, the cost for the additional comparison in the flow key is insignificant, and most distributions have all these options enabled by default anyway. Therefore it makes sense to remove the config options and enable mark based routing by default.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Graf <tgraf@suug.ch> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
