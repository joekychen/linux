f | Makefile | g | 95B |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
f | Kconfig | g | 475B |  | Patrick McHardy | kaber@trash.net | 1201561152 |  | [NETFILTER]: Add CONFIG_NETFILTER_ADVANCED option  The NETFILTER_ADVANCED option hides lots of the rather obscure netfilter options when disabled and provides defaults (M) that should allow to run a distribution firewall without further thinking.  Defaults to 'y' to avoid breaking current configurations.  Signed-off-by: Patrick McHardy <kaber@trash.net> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
