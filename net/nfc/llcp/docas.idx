f | sock.c | s | 16K | 578 | Sasha Levin | levinsasha928@gmail.com | 1339177627 |  | NFC: Fix possible NULL ptr deref when getting the name of a socket  llcp_sock_getname() might get called before the LLCP socket was created. This condition isn't checked, and llcp_sock_getname will simply deref a NULL ptr in that case.  This exists starting with d646960 ("NFC: Initial LLCP support").

f | Kconfig | g | 210B |  | Samuel Ortiz | sameo@linux.intel.com | 1323892213 |  | NFC: Initial LLCP support  This patch is an initial implementation for the NFC Logical Link Control protocol. It's also known as NFC peer to peer mode. This is a basic implementation as it lacks SDP (services Discovery Protocol), frames aggregation support, and frame rejecion parsing. Follow up patches will implement those missing features. This code has been tested against a Nexus S phone implementing LLCP 1.0.
