This simplifies user space code significantly by creating a single interface to listen on that works with both firmware and userland agents.  And if we end up with multiple agents this keeps every thing in sync userland agents, firmware agents, and kernel notifier consumers.  For an example agent that listens for these events see:  https://github.com/jrfastab/cgdcbxd  cgdcbxd is a daemon used to monitor DCB netlink events and manage the net_prio control group sub-system.

In addition, added useful help text for the Kconfig option.  Signed-off-by: Jeff Kirsher <jeffrey.t.kirsher@intel.com> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

If application stacks are expected to keep the skb priority consistent with the dcbx priority the stack will need to be notified when these changes occur.  This patch adds application notifiers for the stack to register with.  Signed-off-by: John Fastabend <john.r.fastabend@intel.com> Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
