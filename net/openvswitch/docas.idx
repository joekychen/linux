Open vSwitch is a multilayer Ethernet switch targeted at virtualized environments.  In addition to supporting a variety of features expected in a traditional hardware switch, it enables fine-grained programmatic extension and flow-based control of the network. This control is useful in a wide variety of applications but is particularly important in multi-server virtualization deployments, which are often characterized by highly dynamic endpoints and the need to maintain logical abstractions for multiple tenants.  The Open vSwitch datapath provides an in-kernel fast path for packet forwarding.  It is complemented by a userspace daemon, ovs-vswitchd, which is able to accept configuration from a variety of sources and translate it into packet processing rules.  See http://openvswitch.org for more information and userspace utilities.  Signed-off-by: Jesse Gross <jesse@nicira.com>

When modifying IP addresses or ports on a UDP packet we don't correctly follow the rules for unchecksummed packets.  This meant that packets without a checksum can be given a incorrect new checksum and packets with a checksum can become marked as being unchecksummed. This fixes it to handle those requirements.
