No generic netlink families except for the controller family are made namespace aware, they need to be checked one by one and then set the family->netnsok member to true.  A new function genlmsg_multicast_netns() is introduced to allow sending a multicast message in a given namespace, for example when it applies to an object that lives in that namespace, a new function genlmsg_multicast_allns() to send a message to all network namespaces (for objects that do not have an associated netns).  The function genlmsg_multicast() is changed to multicast the message in just init_net, which is currently correct for all generic netlink families since they only work in init_net right now. Some will later want to work in all net namespaces because they do not care about the netns at all -- those will have to be converted to use one of the new functions genlmsg_multicast_allns() or genlmsg_multicast_netns() whenever they are made netns aware in some way.  After this patch families can easily decide whether or not they should be available in all net namespaces. Many genl families us it for objects not related to networking and should therefore be available in all namespaces, but that will have to be done on a per family basis.  Note that this doesn't touch on the checkpoint/restart problem where network namespaces could be used, genl families and multicast groups are numbered globally and I see no easy way of changing that, especially since it must be possible to multicast to all network namespaces for those families that do not care about netns.

Rather than destroying the topology server port and breaking its connections to existing subscribers, TIPC now simply lets the service continue running (since the change to the port identifier of each port used by the topology service no longer impacts the flow of messages between the service and its subscribers).  This enhancement means that applications that utilize the topology service prior to the assignment of TIPC's network address no longer need to re-establish their subscriptions when the address is finally assigned.  However, it is worth noting that any subsequent events for existing subscriptions report the new port identifier of the publishing port, rather than the original port identifier. (For example, a name that was previously reported as being published by <0.0.0:ref> may be subsequently withdrawn by <Z.C.N:ref>.)  This doesn't impact any of the existing known userspace in tipc-utils, since (a) TIPC continues to treat references to the original port ID correctly and (b) normal use cases assign an address before active use.  However if there does happen to be some rare/custom application out there that was relying on this, they can simply bypass the enhancement by issuing a subscription to {0,0} and break its connection to the topology service, if an associated withdrawal event occurs.

Delete the extra line feeds between any comment and its associated following block of code, to be consistent with the majority of the rest of the kernel.  Also delete trailing newlines at EOF and fix a couple trivial typos in existing comments.  This is a 100% cosmetic change with no runtime impact.  We get rid of over 500 lines of non-code, and being blank line deletes, they won't even show up as noise in git blame.  Signed-off-by: Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>
