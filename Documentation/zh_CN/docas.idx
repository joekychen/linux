f | SubmittingDrivers | g | 7.5K |  | Michael Witten | mfwitten@gmail.com | 1289861413 |  | Docs/Kconfig: Update: osdl.org -> linuxfoundation.org  Some of the documentation refers to web pages under the domain `osdl.org'. However, `osdl.org' now redirects to `linuxfoundation.org'.  Rather than rely on redirections, this patch updates the addresses appropriately; for the most part, only documentation that is meant to be current has been updated.  The patch should be pretty quick to scan and check; each new web-page url was gotten by trying out the original URL in a browser and then simply copying the the redirected URL (formatting as necessary).  There is some conflict as to which one of these domain names is preferred:    linuxfoundation.org   linux-foundation.org  So, I wrote:    info@linuxfoundation.org  and got this reply:    Message-ID: <4CE17EE6.9040807@linuxfoundation.org>   Date: Mon, 15 Nov 2010 10:41:42 -0800   From: David Ames <david@linuxfoundation.org>    ...    linuxfoundation.org is preferred. The canonical name for our web site is   www.linuxfoundation.org. Our list site is actually   lists.linux-foundation.org.    Regarding email linuxfoundation.org is preferred there are a few people   who choose to use linux-foundation.org for their own reasons.  Consequently, I used `linuxfoundation.org' for web pages and `lists.linux-foundation.org' for mailing-list web pages and email addresses; the only personal email address I updated from `@osdl.org' was that of Andrew Morton, who prefers `linux-foundation.org' according `git log'.
