This can be slow, and is completely unnecessary if the framebuffer we're using can restore video properly.  This adds a hook that allows drivers to select whether or not to do this vt switch, and changes the gxfb driver to call this hook.  It also adds a module param to gxfb to allow controlling of the vt switch (defaulting to no switch).  (Note: I'm not convinced that console_sem is the best way to protect this, but we should probably have some form of locking..)

f | pxafb.txt | g | 4.6K |  | Eric Miao | ycmiao@ycmiao-hp520.(none) | 1230544804 |  | [ARM] pxafb: add support for overlay1 and overlay2 as framebuffer devices  PXA27x and later processors support overlay1 and overlay2 on-top of the base framebuffer (although under-neath the base is also possible). They support palette and no-palette RGB formats, as well as YUV formats (only available on overlay2). These overlays have dedicated DMA channels and behave in a similar way as a framebuffer.  This heavily simplified and re-structured work is based on the original pxafb_overlay.c (which is pending for mainline merge for a long time).  The major problems with this pxafb_overlay.c are (if you are interested in the history):    1. heavily redundant (the control logics for overlay1 and overlay2 are      actually identical except for some small operations,  which are now      abstracted into a 'pxafb_layer_ops' structure)    2. a lot of useless and un-tested code (two workarounds which are now      fixed on mature silicons)    3. cursorfb is actually useless, hardware cursor should not be used      this way, and the code was actually un-tested for a long time.  The code in this patch should be self-explanatory, I tried to add minimum comments. As said, this is basically simplified, there are several things still on the pending list:    1. palette mode is un-supported and un-tested (although re-using the      palette code of the base framebuffer is actually very easy now with      previous clean-up patches)    2. fb_pan_display for overlay(s) is un-supported    3. the base framebuffer can actually be abstracted by 'pxafb_layer' as      well, which will help further re-use of the code and keep a better      and consistent structure. (This is the reason I named it 'pxafb_layer'      instead of 'pxafb_overlay' or something alike)  See Documentation/fb/pxafb.txt for additional usage information.

They also allow to limit these flags to specific outputs. Both things were previously undocumented.  Also the parsing of the line had some oddities: -A lot of misplaced options were silently ignored or partly rejected instead  of stopping the parsing immediately -The 'R' option is documented to follow the 'M' option if specified. It is not  documented that 'M' is needed to specify 'R' (also this is the case for normal  fb drivers). In fact the code is correct for normal fb drivers but wrong for  DRM ones.  The old code allowed 'R' only _before_ 'M' (since it parses backwards) and only  if 'M' is given at all which is not needed for the DRM drivers. -the margins option ('m') was parsed but later ignored even if the later  functions support it. -specifying multiple enable options at the same time did not lead to an error. -specifying something bogus for horizontal resolution (i.e. other things as  digits) did not lead to an error but an invalid resolution was used.  If any errors are encountered the position of the faulting string is now printed to the user and the complete mode is ignored. This gives much more consistent error behaviour.  I also removed some useless assignments and changed the local flag variables to be bool.  Signed-off-by: Rolf Eike Beer <eike-kernel@sf-tec.de> Signed-off-by: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>
