Discard requests bypass crypt queue processing. Bio is simple remapped to underlying device.  Note that discard will be never enabled by default because of security consequences.  It is up to the administrator to enable it for encrypted devices.  (Note that userspace cryptsetup does not understand new optional parameters yet.  Support for this will come later.  Until then, you should use 'dmsetup' to enable and disable this.)  Signed-off-by: Milan Broz <mbroz@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>

f | thin-provisioning.txt | g | 11K |  | Joe Thornber | ejt@redhat.com | 1338679801 |  | dm thin: provide userspace access to pool metadata  This patch implements two new messages that can be sent to the thin pool target allowing it to take a snapshot of the _metadata_.  This, read-only snapshot can be accessed by userland, concurrently with the live target.  Only one metadata snapshot can be held at a time.  The pool's status line will give the block location for the current msnap.  Since version 0.1.5 of the userland thin provisioning tools, the thin_dump program displays the msnap as follows:      thin_dump -m <msnap root> <metadata dev>  Available here: https://github.com/jthornber/thin-provisioning-tools  Now that userland can access the metadata we can do various things that have traditionally been kernel side tasks:       i) Incremental backups.       By using metadata snapshots we can work out what blocks have      changed over time.  Combined with data snapshots we can ensure      the data doesn't change while we back it up.       A short proof of concept script can be found here:       https://github.com/jthornber/thinp-test-suite/blob/master/incremental_backup_example.rb       ii) Migration of thin devices from one pool to another.       iii) Merging snapshots back into an external origin.       iv) Asyncronous replication.
