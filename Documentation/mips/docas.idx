Worse, the document contents are plain misleading nowadays because the text mentions files and directories, which have been deleted, moved or restructured for 2.6.  This patch removes the documentation, which is no more valid.  Signed-off-by: Dmitri Vorobiev <dmitri.vorobiev@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org>
