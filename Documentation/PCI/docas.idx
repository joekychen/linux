These broken references are caused by typo's in the references, and by renames or removals of the Documentation files. Some broken references are simply odd.  Fix these broken references, sometimes by dropping the irrelevant text they were part of.  Signed-off-by: Paul Bolle <pebolle@tiscali.nl> Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>

This patch introduces default_downstream_reset_link that is a version of aer_root_reset() with no accesses to root port's register. It is used for downstream ports that has no reset_link function its specific.  This patch also updates related description in pcieaer-howto.txt. Some minor fixes are included.
