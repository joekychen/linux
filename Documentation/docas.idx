To users of these kernels they are very serious and failing to fix them reduces the value of -stable.  The problem is that the patches fixing these issues are often subtle and prone to regressions in other ways and need greater care and attention. To combat this, these "serious" backports should have a higher barrier to entry.  This patch relaxes the rules to allow a distribution maintainer to merge to -stable a backported patch or small series that fixes a "serious" user-visible performance issue. They should include additional information on the user-visible bug affected and a link to the bugzilla entry if available. The same rules about the patch being already in mainline still apply.

So it's : quite possible that on various architectures the "cpu_relax()" could be : about making sure that such a tight loop on loads doesn't starve cache : transactions, for example - and as such look a bit like a memory barrier : from a CPU standpoint. : : But it's not meant to have any kind of architectural memory ordering : semantics as far as the kernel is concerned - those must come from other : sources.

d | security |  | 12 items |  | Casey Schaufler | casey@schaufler-ca.com | 1337060918 |  | Smack: allow for significantly longer Smack labels v4  V4 updated to current linux-security#next Targeted for git://gitorious.org/smack-next/kernel.git  Modern application runtime environments like to use naming schemes that are structured and generated without human intervention. Even though the Smack limit of 23 characters for a label name is perfectly rational for human use there have been complaints that the limit is a problem in environments where names are composed from a set or sources, including vendor, author, distribution channel and application name. Names like  	softwarehouse-pgwodehouse-coolappstore-mellowmuskrats  are becoming harder to avoid. This patch introduces long label support in Smack. Labels are now limited to 255 characters instead of the old 23.  The primary reason for limiting the labels to 23 characters was so they could be directly contained in CIPSO category sets. This is still done were possible, but for labels that are too large a mapping is required. This is perfectly safe for communication that stays "on the box" and doesn't require much coordination between boxes beyond what would have been required to keep label names consistent.  The bulk of this patch is in smackfs, adding and updating administrative interfaces. Because existing APIs can't be changed new ones that do much the same things as old ones have been introduced.  The Smack specific CIPSO data representation has been removed and replaced with the data format used by netlabel. The CIPSO header is now computed when a label is imported rather than on use. This results in improved IP performance. The smack label is now allocated separately from the containing structure, allowing for larger strings.  Four new /smack interfaces have been introduced as four of the old interfaces strictly required labels be specified in fixed length arrays.  The access interface is supplemented with the check interface: 	access  "Subject                 Object                  rwxat" 	access2 "Subject Object rwaxt"  The load interface is supplemented with the rules interface: 	load   "Subject                 Object                  rwxat" 	load2  "Subject Object rwaxt"  The load-self interface is supplemented with the self-rules interface: 	load-self   "Subject                 Object                  rwxat" 	load-self2  "Subject Object rwaxt"  The cipso interface is supplemented with the wire interface: 	cipso  "Subject                  lvl cnt  c1  c2 ..." 	cipso2 "Subject lvl cnt  c1  c2 ..."  The old interfaces are maintained for compatibility.  Signed-off-by: Casey Schaufler <casey@schaufler-ca.com>

f | xz.txt | g | 5.7K |  | Lasse Collin | lasse.collin@tukaani.org | 1294934604 |  | decompressors: add XZ decompressor module  In userspace, the .lzma format has become mostly a legacy file format that got superseded by the .xz format.  Similarly, LZMA Utils was superseded by XZ Utils.  These patches add support for XZ decompression into the kernel.  Most of the code is as is from XZ Embedded <http://tukaani.org/xz/embedded.html>. It was written for the Linux kernel but is usable in other projects too.  Advantages of XZ over the current LZMA code in the kernel:   - Nice API that can be used by other kernel modules; it's     not limited to kernel, initramfs, and initrd decompression.   - Integrity check support (CRC32)   - BCJ filters improve compression of executable code on     certain architectures. These together with LZMA2 can     produce a few percent smaller kernel or Squashfs images     than plain LZMA without making the decompression slower.  This patch: Add the main decompression code (xz_dec), testing module (xz_dec_test), wrapper script (xz_wrap.sh) for the xz command line tool, and documentation.  The xz_dec module is enough to have a usable XZ decompressor e.g.  for Squashfs.  Signed-off-by: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org> Cc: "H.

f | sgi-ioc4.txt | g | 2.0K |  | Brent Casavant | bcasavan@sgi.com | 1119404792 |  | [PATCH] ioc4: Core driver rewrite  This series of patches reworks the configuration and internal structure of the SGI IOC4 I/O controller device drivers.  These changes are motivated by several factors:  - The IOC4 chip PCI resources are of mixed use between functions (i.e.   multiple functions are handled in the same address range, sometimes   within the same register), muddling resource ownership and initialization   issues.  Centralizing this ownership in a core driver is desirable.  - The IOC4 chip implements multiple functions (serial, IDE, others not   yet implemented in the mainline kernel) but is not a multifunction   PCI device.  In order to properly handle device addition and removal   as well as module insertion and deletion, an intermediary IOC4-specific   driver layer is needed to handle these operations cleanly.  - All IOC4 drivers are currently enabled by a single CONFIG value.  As   not all systems need all IOC4 functions, it is desireable to enable   these drivers independently.  - The current IOC4 core driver will trigger loading of all function-level   drivers, as it makes direct calls to them.  This situation should be   reversed (i.e. function-level drivers cause loading of core driver)   in order to maintain a clear and least-surprise driver loading model.  - IOC4 hardware design necessitates some driver-level dependency on   the PCI bus clock speed.  Current code assumes a 66MHz bus, but the   speed should be autodetected and appropriate compensation taken.  This patch series effects the above changes by a newly and better designed IOC4 core driver with which the function-level drivers can register and deregister themselves upon module insertion/removal.  By tracking these modules, device addition/removal is also handled properly.  PCI resource management and ownership issues are centralized in this core driver, and IOC4-wide configuration actions such as bus speed detection are also handled in this core driver.  This patch:  The SGI IOC4 I/O controller chip implements multiple functions, though it is not a multi-function PCI device.  Additionally, various PCI resources of the IOC4 are shared by multiple hardware functions, and thus resource ownership by driver is not clearly delineated.  Due to the current driver design, all core and subordinate drivers must be loaded, or none, which is undesirable if not all IOC4 hardware features are being used.  This patch reorganizes the IOC4 drivers so that the core driver provides a subdriver registration service.  Through appropriate callbacks the subdrivers can now handle device addition and removal, as well as module insertion and deletion (though the IOC4 IDE driver requires further work before module deletion will work).  The core driver now takes care of allocating PCI resources and data which must be shared between subdrivers, to clearly delineate module ownership of these items.

d | EDID |  | 8 items |  | Carsten Emde | C.Emde@osadl.org | 1332238168 |  | drm: allow loading an EDID as firmware to override broken monitor  Broken monitors and/or broken graphic boards may send erroneous or no EDID data. This also applies to broken KVM devices that are unable to correctly forward the EDID data of the connected monitor but invent their own fantasy data.  This patch allows to specify an EDID data set to be used instead of probing the monitor for it. It contains built-in data sets of frequently used screen resolutions. In addition, a particular EDID data set may be provided in the /lib/firmware directory and loaded via the firmware interface. The name is passed to the kernel as module parameter of the drm_kms_helper module either when loaded   options drm_kms_helper edid_firmware=edid/1280x1024.bin or as kernel commandline parameter   drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1280x1024.bin  It is also possible to restrict the usage of a specified EDID data set to a particular connector. This is done by prepending the name of the connector to the name of the EDID data set using the syntax   edid_firmware=[<connector>:]<edid> such as, for example,   edid_firmware=DVI-I-1:edid/1920x1080.bin in which case no other connector will be affected.  The built-in data sets are Resolution    Name -------------------------------- 1024x768      edid/1024x768.bin 1280x1024     edid/1280x1024.bin 1680x1050     edid/1680x1050.bin 1920x1080     edid/1920x1080.bin  They are ignored, if a file with the same name is available in the /lib/firmware directory.  The built-in EDID data sets are based on standard timings that may not apply to a particular monitor and even crash it. Ideally, EDID data of the connected monitor should be used. They may be obtained through the drm/cardX/cardX-<connector>/edid entry in the /sys/devices PCI directory of a correctly working graphics adapter.  It is even possible to specify the name of an EDID data set on-the-fly via the /sys/module interface, e.g. echo edid/myedid.bin >/sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/edid_firmware The new screen mode is considered when the related kernel function is called for the first time after the change. Such calls are made when the X server is started or when the display settings dialog is opened in an already running X server.

d | crypto |  | 3 items |  | Dan Williams | dan.j.williams@intel.com | 1251598167 |  | async_tx: add support for asynchronous RAID6 recovery operations   async_raid6_2data_recov() recovers two data disk failures   async_raid6_datap_recov() recovers a data disk and the P disk  These routines are a port of the synchronous versions found in drivers/md/raid6recov.c.  The primary difference is breaking out the xor operations into separate calls to async_xor.  Two helper routines are introduced to perform scalar multiplication where needed. async_sum_product() multiplies two sources by scalar coefficients and then sums (xor) the result.  async_mult() simply multiplies a single source by a scalar.  This implemention also includes, in contrast to the original synchronous-only code, special case handling for the 4-disk and 5-disk array cases.  In these situations the default N-disk algorithm will present 0-source or 1-source operations to dma devices.  To cover for dma devices where the minimum source count is 2 we implement 4-disk and 5-disk handling in the recovery code.

Because usually cpumask    is accessed only front bits when the system has cpu-hotplug capability 2) Convert cpu_vm_mask into cpumask_var_t.

d | scheduler |  | 8 items |  | Peter Zijlstra | peterz@infradead.org | 1337255336 |  | sched: Remove stale power aware scheduling remnants and dysfunctional knobs  It's been broken forever (i.e. it's not scheduling in a power aware fashion), as reported by Suresh and others sending patches, and nobody cares enough to fix it properly ... so remove it to make space free for something better.  There's various problems with the code as it stands today, first and foremost the user interface which is bound to topology levels and has multiple values per level. This results in a state explosion which the administrator or distro needs to master and almost nobody does.  Furthermore large configuration state spaces aren't good, it means the thing doesn't just work right because it's either under so many impossibe to meet constraints, or even if there's an achievable state workloads have to be aware of it precisely and can never meet it for dynamic workloads.  So pushing this kind of decision to user-space was a bad idea even with a single knob - it's exponentially worse with knobs on every node of the topology.  There is a proposal to replace the user interface with a single 3 state knob:   sched_balance_policy := { performance, power, auto }  where 'auto' would be the preferred default which looks at things like Battery/AC mode and possible cpufreq state or whatever the hw exposes to show us power use expectations - but there's been no progress on it in the past many months.  Aside from that, the actual implementation of the various knobs is known to be broken. There have been sporadic attempts at fixing things but these always stop short of reaching a mergable state.  Therefore this wholesale removal with the hopes of spurring people who care to come forward once again and work on a coherent replacement.

Hardware with MCA bus is limited to 386 and 486 class machines that are now 20+ years old and typically with less than 32MB of memory.  A quick search on the internet, and you see that even the MCA hobbyist/enthusiast community has lost interest in the early 2000 era and never really even moved ahead from the 2.4 kernels to the 2.6 series.  This deletes anything remaining related to CONFIG_MCA from core kernel code and from the x86 architecture.  There is no point in carrying this any further into the future.  One complication to watch for is inadvertently scooping up stuff relating to machine check, since there is overlap in the TLA name space (e.g. arch/x86/boot/mca.c).

With hot-replace a spare can be activated and recovery can start while the original device is still in place, thus allowing a transition from an unreliable device to a reliable device without leaving the array degraded during the transition.  It can also be use when the original device is still reliable but it not wanted for some reason.  This will eventually be supported in RAID4/5/6 and RAID10.  This patch adds a super-block flag to distinguish the replacement device.  If an old kernel sees this flag it will reject the device.  It also adds two per-device flags which are viewable and settable via sysfs.    "want_replacement" can be set to request that a device be replaced.    "replacement" is set to show that this device is replacing another    device.  The "rd%d" links in /sys/block/mdXx/md only apply to the original device, not the replacement.

A quick search on the internet, and you see that even the MCA hobbyist/enthusiast community has lost interest in the early 2000 era and never really even moved ahead from the 2.4 kernels to the 2.6 series.  This deletes anything remaining related to CONFIG_MCA from core kernel code and from the x86 architecture.  There is no point in carrying this any further into the future.

This patch removes the single vdev limitation of the remoteproc framework so multi-vdev firmwares can be leveraged: VDEV resource entries are parsed when the rproc is registered, and as a result their vrings are set up and the virtio devices are registered (and they go away when the rproc goes away).  Moreover, we no longer only support VIRTIO_ID_RPMSG vdevs; any virtio device type goes now. As a result, there's no more any rpmsg-specific APIs or code in remoteproc: it all becomes generic virtio handling.

d | leds |  | 6 items |  | Shuah Khan | shuahkhan@gmail.com | 1338333752 |  | leds: add new transient trigger for one shot timer activation  The leds timer trigger does not currently have an interface to activate a one shot timer.  The current support allows for setting two timers, one for specifying how long a state to be on, and the second for how long the state to be off.  The delay_on value specifies the time period an LED should stay in on state, followed by a delay_off value that specifies how long the LED should stay in off state.  The on and off cycle repeats until the trigger gets deactivated.  There is no provision for one time activation to implement features that require an on or off state to be held just once and then stay in the original state forever.  Without one shot timer interface, user space can still use timer trigger to set a timer to hold a state, however when user space application crashes or goes away without deactivating the timer, the hardware will be left in that state permanently.  As a specific example of this use-case, let's look at vibrate feature on phones.  Vibrate function on phones is implemented using PWM pins on SoC or PMIC.  There is a need to activate one shot timer to control the vibrate feature, to prevent user space crashes leaving the phone in vibrate mode permanently causing the battery to drain.  This trigger exports three properties, activate, state, and duration When transient trigger is activated these properties are set to default values.  - duration allows setting timer value in msecs. The initial value is 0. - activate allows activating and deactivating the timer specified by   duration as needed. The initial and default value is 0.  This will allow   duration to be set after trigger activation. - state allows user to specify a transient state to be held for the specified   duration.

A major reason for returning -EBUSY from ->pre_destroy() is that the 'moving' hits the parent's resource limitation.  It happens only when use_hierarchy=0.  Considering use_hierarchy=0, all cgroups should be flat.  So, no one cannot justify moving charges to parent...parent and children are in flat configuration, not hierarchical.  This patch modifes the code to move charges to the root cgroup at rmdir/force_empty if use_hierarchy==0.  This will much simplify rmdir() and reduce error in ->pre_destroy.

They were mostly limited   to 386-sx 16MHz CPU and some 486 class machines and never more than   64MB of RAM.  Even the enthusiast hobbyist community seems to have   dried up close to ten years ago, based on what you can find searching   various websites dedicated to the relatively short lived hardware.    So lets remove the support relating to CONFIG_MCA.  There is no point   carrying this forward, wasting cycles doing routine maintenance on it;   wasting allyesconfig build time on validating it, wasting I/O on git   grep'ping over it, and so on."  Let's see if anybody screams.  It generally has compiled, and James Bottomley pointed out that there was a MCA extension from NCR that allowed for up to 4GB of memory and PPro-class machines.  So in *theory* there may be users out there.  But even James (technically listed as a maintainer) doesn't actually have a system, and while Alan Cox claims to have a machine in his cellar that he offered to anybody who wants to take it off his hands, he didn't argue for keeping MCA support either.

They were mostly limited   to 386-sx 16MHz CPU and some 486 class machines and never more than   64MB of RAM.  Even the enthusiast hobbyist community seems to have   dried up close to ten years ago, based on what you can find searching   various websites dedicated to the relatively short lived hardware.    So lets remove the support relating to CONFIG_MCA.  There is no point   carrying this forward, wasting cycles doing routine maintenance on it;   wasting allyesconfig build time on validating it, wasting I/O on git   grep'ping over it, and so on."  Let's see if anybody screams.  It generally has compiled, and James Bottomley pointed out that there was a MCA extension from NCR that allowed for up to 4GB of memory and PPro-class machines.  So in *theory* there may be users out there.  But even James (technically listed as a maintainer) doesn't actually have a system, and while Alan Cox claims to have a machine in his cellar that he offered to anybody who wants to take it off his hands, he didn't argue for keeping MCA support either.  So we could bring it back.  But somebody had better speak up and talk about how they have actually been using said MCA hardware with modern kernels for us to do that.

f | rpmsg.txt | g | 13K |  | Ohad Ben-Cohen | ohad@wizery.com | 1328734438 |  | rpmsg: add virtio-based remote processor messaging bus  Add a virtio-based inter-processor communication bus, which enables kernel drivers to communicate with entities, running on remote processors, over shared memory using a simple messaging protocol.  Every pair of AMP processors share two vrings, which are used to send and receive the messages over shared memory.  The header of every message sent on the rpmsg bus contains src and dst addresses, which make it possible to multiplex several rpmsg channels on the same vring.  Every rpmsg channel is a device on this bus. When a channel is added, and an appropriate rpmsg driver is found and probed, it is also assigned a local rpmsg address, which is then bound to the driver's callback.  When inbound messages carry the local address of a bound driver, its callback is invoked by the bus.  This patch provides a kernel interface only; user space interfaces will be later exposed by kernel users of this rpmsg bus.  Designed with Brian Swetland <swetland@google.com>.

This made large side effect.  When user need to use two mqueue applications 1) using !NULL attr parameter and it require big message size and 2) using NULL attr parameter and only need small size message, app (1) require to raise fs.mqueue.msgsize_max and app (2) consume large memory size even though it doesn't need.  Doug Ledford propsed to switch back it to static hard coded value. However it also has a compatibility problem.  Some applications might started depend on the default value is tunable.  The solution is to separate default value from maximum value.

d | namespaces |  | 1 items |  | Pavel Emelyanov | xemul@openvz.org | 1196357093 |  | The namespaces compatibility list doc  People discuss how the namespaces are working/going-to-work together.  Ted Ts'o proposed to create some document that describes what problems user may have when he/she creates some new namespace, but keeps others shared. I liked this idea, so here's the initial version of such a document with the problems I currently have in mind and can describe somewhat audibly - the "namespaces compatibility list".  The Documentation/namespaces/ directory is about to contain more docs about the namespaces stuff.  Thanks to Cedirc for notes and spell checks on the doc, to Daniel for additional info about IPC and User namespaces interaction and to Randy, who alluded me to using a spell checker before sending the documentation :)  Signed-off-by: Pavel Emelyanov <xemul@openvz.org> Cc: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com> Cc: Daniel Lezcano <dlezcano@fr.ibm.com> Cc: Theodore Tso <tytso@mit.edu> Cc: Cedric Le Goater <clg@fr.ibm.com> Cc: "Eric W.

d | spi |  | 10 items |  | Linus Walleij | linus.walleij@linaro.org | 1331173188 |  | spi: create a message queueing infrastructure  This rips the message queue in the PL022 driver out and pushes it into (optional) common infrastructure. Drivers that want to use the message pumping thread will need to define the new per-messags transfer methods and leave the deprecated transfer() method as NULL.  Most of the design is described in the documentation changes that are included in this patch.  Since there is a queue that need to be stopped when the system is suspending/resuming, two new calls are implemented for the device drivers to call in their suspend()/resume() functions: spi_master_suspend() and spi_master_resume().  ChangeLog v1->v2: - Remove Kconfig entry and do not make the queue support optional   at all, instead be more agressive and have it as part of the   compulsory infrastructure. - If the .transfer() method is implemented, delete print a small   deprecation notice and do not start the transfer pump. - Fix a bitrotted comment. ChangeLog v2->v3: - Fix up a problematic sequence courtesy of Chris Blair. - Stop rather than destroy the queue on suspend() courtesy of   Chris Blair.

f | hwspinlock.txt | g | 12K |  | Ohad Ben-Cohen | ohad@wizery.com | 1316623534 |  | hwspinlock/core: register a bank of hwspinlocks in a single API call  Hardware Spinlock devices usually contain numerous locks (known devices today support between 32 to 256 locks).  Originally hwspinlock core required drivers to register (and later, when needed, unregister) each lock separately.  That worked, but required hwspinlocks drivers to do a bit extra work when they were probed/removed.  This patch changes hwspin_lock_{un}register() to allow a bank of hwspinlocks to be {un}registered in a single invocation.  A new 'struct hwspinlock_device', which contains an array of 'struct hwspinlock's is now being passed to the core upon registration (so instead of wrapping each struct hwspinlock, a priv member has been added to allow drivers to piggyback their private data with each hwspinlock).  While at it, several per-lock members were moved to be per-device: 1. struct device *dev 2. struct hwspinlock_ops *ops  In addition, now that the array of locks is handled by the core, there's no reason to maintain a per-lock 'int id' member: the id of the lock anyway equals to its index in the bank's array plus the bank's base_id. Remove this per-lock id member too, and instead use a simple pointers arithmetic to derive it.  As a result of this change, hwspinlocks drivers are now simpler and smaller (about %20 code reduction) and the memory footprint of the hwspinlock framework is reduced.
