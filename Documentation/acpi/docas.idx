One can utilize this new parameter to do some SRAR injection test. Pay attention, the operation is highly depended on the BIOS implementation. If no proper BIOS supports it, even if enabling this parameter, expected result will not happen.  v2:   Update the documentation suggested by Tony  Suggested-by: Tony Luck <tony.luck@intel.com> Signed-off-by: Chen Gong <gong.chen@linux.intel.com> Signed-off-by: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>

There might be other    users of it later.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de> Acked-by: Rafael J.

It did ugly things to the init sequence to populate the rootfs image early, but that just ended up showing other problems with the whole approach.  The fact is, the VFS layer simply isn't initialized this early, and the relevant ACPI code should either run much later, or this shouldn't be done at all.  For 2.6.25, we'll just pick the latter option.  We can revisit this concept later if necessary.

Move the list of masks to Documentation/acpi/debug.txt (these are copies of the authoritative values in acoutput.h and acpi_drivers.h).
