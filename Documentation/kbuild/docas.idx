f | kconfig.txt | g | 6.7K |  | Eric W. Biederman | ebiederm@xmission.com | 1336170247 |  | kconfig: Add error handling to KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG  - Only try to read the file specified if KCONFIG_ALL_CONFIG is set to   something other than the empty string or "1".  - Don't use stat to check the name passed to conf_read_simple so that   zconf_fopen can find the file in the current directory or in SRCTREE   removing a extremely source of confusing failure, where KCONFIG_ALL_CONFIG   was not interpreted with respect to the directory make was called in.  - If conf_read_simple fails complain clearly and stop processing.   Allowing the simple debugging of typos.  - Clearly document the behavior so it is clear to users which   values are treated as flags and which values are treated as   filenames.

This target can generate files that need to be installed for user space by "make headers_install" or "make headers_install_all".  In order to support "make headers_install_all", it must be able to run without the tree having to be configured first.
