The primary difference is breaking out the xor operations into separate calls to async_xor.  Two helper routines are introduced to perform scalar multiplication where needed. async_sum_product() multiplies two sources by scalar coefficients and then sums (xor) the result.  async_mult() simply multiplies a single source by a scalar.  This implemention also includes, in contrast to the original synchronous-only code, special case handling for the 4-disk and 5-disk array cases.  In these situations the default N-disk algorithm will present 0-source or 1-source operations to dma devices.  To cover for dma devices where the minimum source count is 2 we implement 4-disk and 5-disk handling in the recovery code.

It also removes the obsolete Configuration Notes section and adds the linux-crypto mailing list as the primary bug reporting address.  Finally it documents the fact that setkey should only be called from user context.  Signed-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
