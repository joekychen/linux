f | sony-laptop.txt | g | 5.7K |  | John Hughes | john@calvaedi.com | 1332259323 |  | to fix scancodes returned by sony-laptop driver  Fix scancodes returned by driver to match scancodes used to remap keys.  (Before the patch FN/E returned scancode 0x1B, but to remap scancode 0x14 had to be used).  The scancodes returned by the sony-laptop driver for function keys did not match the scancodes used to remap keys.  Also, since the scancode was sent to the input subsystem after the mapped keysym the /lib/udev/keymap utility was confused about which scancode to report for which keysym.  This patch fixes the driver so the correct scancode is shown for each key.  It also adds to the documentation a description of where to find the scancodes.

f | disk-shock-protection.txt | g | 6.7K |  | Elias Oltmanns | eo@nebensachen.de | 1223926790 |  | ata: Add documentation for hard disk shock protection interface (v3)  Put some information (and pointers to more) into the kernel's doc tree, describing briefly the interface to the kernel's disk head unloading facility. Information about how to set up a complete shock protection system under GNU/Linux can be found on the web and is referenced accordingly.  v3: Here is some final polish including various spelling corrections pointed out by Grant Grundler and Peter Moulder. Also, I have added some information about the timing constraints related to disk head parking. The patch looks more impressive than it really is and I think it would be alright just to incorporate it into the original patch so as not to clutter up the git log.
