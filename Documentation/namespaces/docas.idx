Ted Ts'o proposed to create some document that describes what problems user may have when he/she creates some new namespace, but keeps others shared. I liked this idea, so here's the initial version of such a document with the problems I currently have in mind and can describe somewhat audibly - the "namespaces compatibility list".  The Documentation/namespaces/ directory is about to contain more docs about the namespaces stuff.  Thanks to Cedirc for notes and spell checks on the doc, to Daniel for additional info about IPC and User namespaces interaction and to Randy, who alluded me to using a spell checker before sending the documentation :)  Signed-off-by: Pavel Emelyanov <xemul@openvz.org> Cc: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com> Cc: Daniel Lezcano <dlezcano@fr.ibm.com> Cc: Theodore Tso <tytso@mit.edu> Cc: Cedric Le Goater <clg@fr.ibm.com> Cc: "Eric W.
