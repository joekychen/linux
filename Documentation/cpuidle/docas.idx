f | sysfs.txt | g | 3.0K |  | ShuoX Liu | shuox.liu@intel.com | 1333086778 |  | cpuidle: add a sysfs entry to disable specific C state for debug purpose.  Some C states of new CPU might be not good.  One reason is BIOS might configure them incorrectly.  To help developers root cause it quickly, the patch adds a new sysfs entry, so developers could disable specific C state manually.  In addition, C state might have much impact on performance tuning, as it takes much time to enter/exit C states, which might delay interrupt processing.  With the new debug option, developers could check if a deep C state could impact performance and how much impact it could cause.  Also add this option in Documentation/cpuidle/sysfs.txt.
