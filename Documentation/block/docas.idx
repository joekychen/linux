f | biodoc.txt | g | 53K |  | Paul Bolle | pebolle@tiscali.nl | 1317139684 |  | doc: fix broken references  There are numerous broken references to Documentation files (in other Documentation files, in comments, etc.). These broken references are caused by typo's in the references, and by renames or removals of the Documentation files. Some broken references are simply odd.  Fix these broken references, sometimes by dropping the irrelevant text they were part of.  Signed-off-by: Paul Bolle <pebolle@tiscali.nl> Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>

This is done by adding a new sysfs file "capability_flags", which is documented in (insert file name).  This sysfs file will export all disk capabilities flags to user space.  We also define a new flag to define the media change notification capability.

f | cfq-iosched.txt | g | 5.7K |  | Vivek Goyal | vgoyal@redhat.com | 1312530140 |  | cfq-iosched: Add documentation about idling  There are always questions about why CFQ is idling on various conditions. Recent ones is Christoph asking again why to idle on REQ_NOIDLE. His assertion is that XFS is relying more and more on workqueues and is concerned that CFQ idling on IO from every workqueue will impact XFS badly.  So he suggested that I add some more documentation about CFQ idling and that can provide more clarity on the topic and also gives an opprotunity to poke a hole in theory and lead to improvements.  So here is my attempt at that. Any comments are welcome.  Signed-off-by: Vivek Goyal <vgoyal@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: Jens Axboe <jaxboe@fusionio.com>
f | queue-sysfs.txt | g | 2.5K |  | Dan Williams | dan.j.williams@intel.com | 1311446665 |  | block: strict rq_affinity  Some systems benefit from completions always being steered to the strict requester cpu rather than the looser "per-socket" steering that blk_cpu_to_group() attempts by default. This is because the first CPU in the group mask ends up being completely overloaded with work, while the others (including the original submitter) has power left to spare.  Allow the strict mode to be set by writing '2' to the sysfs control file. This is identical to the scheme used for the nomerges file, where '2' is a more aggressive setting than just being turned on.  echo 2 > /sys/block/<bdev>/queue/rq_affinity  Cc: Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org> Cc: Roland Dreier <roland@purestorage.com> Tested-by: Dave Jiang <dave.jiang@intel.com> Signed-off-by: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com> Signed-off-by: Jens Axboe <jaxboe@fusionio.com>

I'm not completely sure it's accurate - Jens, could you give a yea or nay on this?  In particular, the counts of read/write IOs and read/write sectors are incremented in different places - it looks like they both increment as the request is being finished, but I'm not completely sure of that.
