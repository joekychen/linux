Unfortunately the OF binding added in c519ecf2 ("ARM: 7009/1: l2x0: Add OF based initialization") does not represent the interrupt.  This patch adds an "interrupts" property to the L2x0 OF binding, representing the combined interrupt line.

This patch adds a new versatile platform for when using the device tree.  Add platform and amba devices are discovered and registered by parsing the device tree.  Clocks and initial io mappings are still configured statically.  This patch still depends on some static platform_data for a few devices which is passed via the auxdata structure to of_platform_populate(), but it is a viable starting point until the drivers can get all configuration data out of the device tree.
