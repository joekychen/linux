Some advocate putting SoC names everywhere in case software needs to work around some chip-specific bug, but more precise SoC information already exists in SVR, and board information already exists in the top-level device tree node.  Note that sometimes the SoC name is a worse identifier than the block version, as the block version can change between revisions of the same SoC.  As a matter of historical reference, neither SEC versions 2.x nor 3.x (driven by talitos) ever needed CHIP references.
