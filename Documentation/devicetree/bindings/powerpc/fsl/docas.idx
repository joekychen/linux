f | board.txt | g | 1.8K |  | Timur Tabi | timur@freescale.com | 1318394844 |  | powerpc/85xx: clean up FPGA device tree nodes for Freecsale QorIQ boards  Standarize and document the FPGA nodes used on Freescale QorIQ reference boards.  There are different kinds of FPGAs used on the boards, but only two are currently standard: "pixis", "ngpixis", and "qixis".  Although there are minor differences among the boards that have one kind of FPGA, most of the functionality is the same, so it makes sense to create common compatibility strings.  We also need to update the P1022DS platform file, because the compatible string for its PIXIS node has changed.  This means that older kernels are not compatible with newer device trees.  This is not a real problem, however, since that particular function doesn't work anyway.  When the DIU is active, the PIXIS is in "indirect mode", and so cannot be accessed as a memory-mapped device.

Currently the example doesn't describe TCRx at all.  The one upstream device tree with an mpic timer node (p1022ds) uses one large reg region to describe both, even though there are other unrelated registers in between.  That device tree also contains a bogus interrupt specifier, and there's no upstream software that uses this yet, so changing this shouldn't be a problem.  Add a full binding for the MPIC timer node, not just an example of 4-cell interrupts in the MPIC binding.  Add fsl,available-ranges, similar to msi-available-ranges.
