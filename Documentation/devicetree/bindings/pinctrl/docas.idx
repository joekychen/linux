This is all based on the new common pinctrl bindings.  Add Tegra30 binding based on Tegra20 binding.  Add some basic stuff that was missing before: * How many and what reg property entries must be provided. * An example.

For select input setting, the driver will handle it internally and do not need user to take care of it.  The pinctrl-imx core driver will parse the dts file and dynamically create the pinmux functions and groups.  Each IMX SoC pinctrl driver should register pins with a pin register map including mux register and config register and select input map to core for proper operations.
