f | sodaville.txt | g | 1.5K |  | Sebastian Andrzej Siewior | bigeasy@linutronix.de | 1328310805 |  | gpio: Add a driver for Sodaville GPIO controller  Sodaville has GPIO controller behind the PCI bus. To my suprissed it is not the same as on PXA.  The interrupt & gpio chip can be referenced from the device tree like from any other driver. Unfortunately the driver which uses the gpio interrupt has to use irq_of_parse_and_map() instead of platform_get_irq(). The problem is that the platform device (which is created from the device tree) is most likely created before the interrupt chip is registered and therefore irq_of_parse_and_map() fails.  In theory the driver works as module. In reality most of the irq functions are not exported to modules and it is possible that _this_ module is unloaded while the provided irqs are still in use.

The Serial To Parallel (STP) is found on MIPS based Lantiq socs. It is a peripheral controller used to drive external shift register cascades. At most 3 groups of 8 bits can be driven. The hardware is able to allow the DSL modem to drive the 2 LSBs of the cascade automatically. Newer socs are also able to automatically drive some pins via the internal PHYs. The driver currently only supports output functionality. Patches for the input feature found on newer generations of the soc will be provided in a later series.
