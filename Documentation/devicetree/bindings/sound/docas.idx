These GPIOs can now be parsed out of device tree.  b) Machine-specific DAPM route arrays embedded into the ASoC machine    driver itself. Historically, the driver picks the appropriate array    to use using machine_is_*(). The driver now requires this array to    be parsed from device tree when instantiated through device tree,    using the core ASoC support for this parsing.
