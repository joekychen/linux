This patch adds a new versatile platform for when using the device tree.  Add platform and amba devices are discovered and registered by parsing the device tree.  Clocks and initial io mappings are still configured statically.  This patch still depends on some static platform_data for a few devices which is passed via the auxdata structure to of_platform_populate(), but it is a viable starting point until the drivers can get all configuration data out of the device tree.

f | mdio-mux.txt | g | 3.4K |  | David Daney | david.daney@cavium.com | 1336445889 |  | netdev/of/phy: Add MDIO bus multiplexer support.  This patch adds a somewhat generic framework for MDIO bus multiplexers.  It is modeled on the I2C multiplexer.  The multiplexer is needed if there are multiple PHYs with the same address connected to the same MDIO bus adepter, or if there is insufficient electrical drive capability for all the connected PHY devices.  Conceptually it could look something like this:                     ------------------                    || Control Signal ||                    --------+---------                            ||  ---------------   --------+------  || MDIO MASTER ||---|| Multiplexer ||  ---------------   --+-------+----                      ||       ||                      C       C                      h       h                      i       i                      l       l                      d       d                      ||       ||      ---------       A       B   ---------      ||       ||       ||       ||   ||       ||      || PHY@1 +-------+       +---+ PHY@1 ||      ||       ||       ||       ||   ||       ||      ---------       ||       ||   ---------      ---------       ||       ||   ---------      ||       ||       ||       ||   ||       ||      || PHY@2 +-------+       +---+ PHY@2 ||      ||       ||                   ||       ||      ---------                   ---------  This framework configures the bus topology from device tree data.  The mechanics of switching the multiplexer is left to device specific drivers.  The follow-on patch contains a multiplexer driven by GPIO lines.
