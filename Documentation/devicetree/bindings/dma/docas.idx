The driver isn't actually instantiated from this node yet, but the I2S binding will rely on being able to refer to the APB DMA node using a phandle.

f | arm-pl330.txt | g | 989B |  | Thomas Abraham | thomas.abraham@linaro.org | 1324602424 |  | DMA: PL330: Add device tree support  For PL330 dma controllers instantiated from device tree, the channel lookup is based on phandle of the dma controller and dma request id specified by the client node. During probe, the private data of each channel of the controller is set to point to the device node of the dma controller. The 'chan_id' of the each channel is used as the dma request id.  Client driver requesting dma channels specify the phandle of the dma controller and the request id. The pl330 filter function converts the phandle to the device node pointer and matches that with channel's private data. If a match is found, the request id from the client node and the 'chan_id' of the channel is matched. A channel is found if both the values match.
