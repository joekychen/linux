f | open-pic.txt | g | 3.1K |  | Meador Inge | meador_inge@mentor.com | 1300665652 |  | powerpc: Document the Open PIC device tree binding  This binding documents several properties that have been in use for quite some time, and adds one new property 'pic-no-reset', which controls the runtime initialization behavior of the PIC.  More specifically, the presence of 'pic-no-reset' mandates that the PIC shall not be reset during runtime initialization and that any initialization related to interrupt sources shall be limited to sources explicitly referenced in the device tree.  This functionality is useful in AMP systems where multiple OSes are sharing the PIC and the reinitialization of the PIC can interfere with OSes that are already up and running.  The interrupt specifier definition is based off of Stuart Yoder's FSL MPIC binding.

d | c6x |  | 6 items |  | Mark Salter | msalter@redhat.com | 1317944853 |  | C6X: devicetree support  This is the basic devicetree support for C6X. Currently, four boards are supported. Each one uses a different SoC part. Two of the four supported SoCs are multicore. One with 3 cores and the other with 6 cores. There is no coherency between the core-level caches, so SMP is not an option. It is possible to run separate kernel instances on the various cores. There is currently no C6X bootloader support for device trees so we build in the DTB for now.  There are some interesting twists to the hardware which are of note for device tree support. Each core has its own interrupt controller which is controlled by special purpose core registers. This core controller provides 12 general purpose prioritized interrupt sources. Each core is contained within a hardware "module" which provides L1 and L2 caches, power control, and another interrupt controller which cascades into the core interrupt controller. These core module functions are controlled by memory mapped registers. The addresses for these registers are the same for each core. That is, when coreN accesses a module-level MMIO register at a given address, it accesses the register for coreN even though other cores would use the same address to access the register in the module containing those cores. Other hardware modules (timers, enet, etc) which are memory mapped can be accessed by all cores.  The timers need some further explanation for multicore SoCs. Even though all timer control registers are visible to all cores, interrupt routing or other considerations may make a given timer more suitable for use by a core than some other timer. Because of this and the desire to have the same image run on more than one core, the timer nodes have a "ti,core-mask" property which is used by the driver to scan for a suitable timer to use.

The last change to the series was before the weekend the   removal of an SPI patch which Grant - even though previously acked by   himself - appeared to raise objections.  So I removed it until the   situation is clarified.  Other than that all the patches have the acks   from their respective maintainers, all MIPS and x86 defconfigs are   building fine and I'm not aware of any problems introduced by this   series.    Among the key features for this patch series is a sizable patchset for   Lantiq which among other things introduces support for Lantiq's   flagship product, the FALCON SOC.  It also means that the opensource   developers behind this patchset have overtaken Lantiq's competing   inhouse development team that was working behind closed doors.    Less noteworthy the ath79 patchset which adds support for a few more   chip variants, cleanups and fixes.  Finally the usual dose of tweaking   of generic code."
