f | spear-adc.txt | g | 848B |  | Stefan Roese | sr@denx.de | 1334341103 |  | staging:iio:adc: Add SPEAr ADC driver  This patch implements the basic single data conversion support for the SPEAr600 SoC ADC. The register layout of SPEAr600 differs a bit from other SPEAr SoC variants (e.g. SPEAr3xx). These differences are handled via DT compatible testing. Resulting in a multi-arch binary.  This driver is currently tested only on SPEAr600. Future patches may add support for other SoC variants (SPEAr3xx) and features like software buffer or DMA.
