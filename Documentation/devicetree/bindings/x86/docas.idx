Reflect this change in the documentation.

I have the compatible string   for pci so I can drop the device_type once it is possible - I lowercased all compatible types. I will need to resend some patches   which have upper case intel - The cpu had the same compatible string as the soc node. So I added to   the soc node -immr for internel memory mapped registers. - I added generic names for all parts. - I reworked the i2c bars matching the way you suggested. I added a   compatible node for the PCI device which only the PCI ids in its   compatible string. The bars (each represents a complete i2c   controller) have a "intel,ce4100-i2c-controller" compatible node. It   is not used by the driver.   The driver is probed via PCI ids (by the pci subsystem not OF) and   matches the bar address against the ressource in the child node. Once   there is a hit the node is attached. - The SPI driver is also probed via pci. However I also attached a   compatible property based on PCI ids  v2..v3: - intel,ce4100-immr become intel,ce4100-cp. cp stands for core   peripherals. The Atom data sheet talks here about ACPI devices. Since   we don't have ACPI this does not apply here. - The interrupt map is gone. There are now plenty of device nodes. - The "unit address string" got fixed, it uses not DD,V format.  v3..v4: - added descriptions for compatible nodes introduced here:   - intel,ce4100-ioapic   - intel,ce4100-lapic   - intel,ce4100-hpet   - intel,ce4100   - intel,ce4100-cp   - intel,ce4100-pci - added a description about I2C controller magic. - Added gpio-controller and gpio-cells property to gpio devices. Those   properties are not (yet) used.
