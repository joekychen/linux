In ds2423 the counters are tied to ram pages 12-15 in and each of those ram-pages.  Each of these counter values (and asoociated ram page values) are represented as a own line in w1_slave file.  Driver has been tested on mips and x86.  usage example: cat /sys/bus/w1/devices/1d-00000009b964/w1_slave  00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 6d 38 00 ff ff 00 00 fe ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff crc=YES c=2 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 1f 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff crc=YES c=2 00 5a 0e 5f 18 00 00 00 00 0b 28 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff 00 00 ff ff crc=YES c=408882778 00 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 8d 39 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff crc=YES c=5  Patch includes also the documentation.
