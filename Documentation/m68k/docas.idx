f | kernel-options.txt | g | 32K |  | Will Drewry | wad@chromium.org | 1312417521 |  | Documentation: add pointer to name_to_dev_t for root= values  Update kernel-parameters.txt to point users to the authoritative comment for name_to_dev_t.  In addition, updates other places where some name_to_dev_t behavior was discussed.  All other references to root= appear to be for explicit sample usage or just side comments when discussing other kernel parameters.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
