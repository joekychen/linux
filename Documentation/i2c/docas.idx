f | ten-bit-addresses | g | 1.2K |  | Jean Delvare | khali@linux-fr.org | 1322044387 |  | i2c: Fix device name for 10-bit slave address  10-bit addresses overlap with traditional 7-bit addresses, leading in device name collisions. Add an arbitrary offset to 10-bit addresses to prevent this collision. The offset was chosen so that the address is still easily recognizable.

Also strengthen the disrecommendation of the protocol mangling while we're at it.  In the case of regmap-i2c we remove the requirement for mangling as I2C_M_NOSTART is the only mangling feature which is being used.

f | old-module-parameters | g | 1.9K |  | Jean Delvare | khali@linux-fr.org | 1260115584 |  | i2c: Drop probe, ignore and force module parameters  The legacy probe and force module parameters are obsolete now, the same can be achieved using the new_device sysfs interface, which is both more flexible and cheaper (it is implemented by i2c-core rather than replicated in every driver module.)  The legacy ignore module parameters can be dropped as well. Ignoring can be done by instantiating a "dummy" device at the problematic address.  This is the first step of a huge cleanup to i2c-core's i2c_detect function, i2c.h's I2C_CLIENT_INSMOD* macros, and all drivers that made use of them.  Signed-off-by: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
