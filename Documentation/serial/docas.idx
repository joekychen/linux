The support for CONFIG_MCA is being removed, since the 20 year old hardware simply isn't capable of meeting today's software demands on CPU and memory resources.  This commit removes the MCA specific 8250 UART code.

In particular, crisv10.c uses SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND and SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND for the voltage of the RTS pin; atmel_serial.c, instead, uses these values to know if a delay must be set before and after sending.  This patch makes the usage of these variables consistent across all drivers and fixes the Documentation as well.  From now on, SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND and SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND will be used to set the voltage of the RTS pin (as in the crisv10.c driver); the delay will be understood by looking only at the value of delay_rts_before_send and delay_rts_after_send.
