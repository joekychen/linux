So fix its documentation and comment to make callers clear about it.  Signed-off-by: Ming Lei <tom.leiming@gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
f | hotplug-script | g | 443B |  | Magnus Damm | damm@opensource.se | 1281041614 |  | firmware: Update hotplug script  Update the in-kernel hotplug example script to work properly with recent kernels. Without this fix the script may load the firmware twice - both at "add" and "remove" time.  The second load only triggers in the case when multiple firmware images are used. A good example is the b43 driver which does not work properly without this fix.  Signed-off-by: Magnus Damm <damm@opensource.se> Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
