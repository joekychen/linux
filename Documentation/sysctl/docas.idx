This made large side effect.  When user need to use two mqueue applications 1) using !NULL attr parameter and it require big message size and 2) using NULL attr parameter and only need small size message, app (1) require to raise fs.mqueue.msgsize_max and app (2) consume large memory size even though it doesn't need.  Doug Ledford propsed to switch back it to static hard coded value. However it also has a compatibility problem.  Some applications might started depend on the default value is tunable.  The solution is to separate default value from maximum value.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
