Though this is not an ideal use of the chip, some hardware engineers may decide that the LTC4245 meets their design requirements when studying the datasheet.  The GPIO pins are sampled in round-robin fashion, meaning that a slow reader will see stale data. A userspace application can detect this, because it will get -EAGAIN when reading from a sysfs file which contains stale data.  Users can choose to use this feature on a per-chip basis by using either platform data or the OF device tree (where applicable).  Signed-off-by: Ira W.

Since the watchdog is part of the hwmon logical device and thus shares ioports with it, the watchdog driver is integrated into the existing hwmon drivers for these.  Note that this version of the watchdog support for sch56xx superio-s implements the watchdog chardev interface itself, rather then relying on the recently added watchdog core / watchdog_dev. This is done because currently some needed functionality is missing from watchdog_dev, as soon as this functionality is added (which is being discussed on the linux-watchdog mailinglist), I'll convert this driver over to using watchdog_dev.
