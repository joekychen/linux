Drivers wishing to override certain settings may do so in the callback function, but they no longer need to parse the CIS entries stored in cistpl_cftable_entry_t themselves.

f | devicetable.txt | g | 1.3K |  | Randy Dunlap | rdunlap@xenotime.net | 1151698150 |  | [PATCH] pcmcia: expose tool in pcmcia/Documentation/pcmcia/  Expose example and tool source files in the Documentation/ directory in their own files instead of being buried (almost hidden) in readme/txt files.  This will make them more visible/usable to users who may need to use them, to developers who may need to test with them, and to janitors who would update them if they were more visible.  Also, if any of these possibly should not be in the kernel tree at all, it will be clearer that they are here and we can discuss if they should be removed.

f | Makefile | g | 266B |  | Randy Dunlap | randy.dunlap@oracle.com | 1218582450 |  | docsrc: build Documentation/ sources  Currently source files in the Documentation/ sub-dir can easily bit-rot since they are not generally buildable, either because they are hidden in text files or because there are no Makefile rules for them.  This needs to be fixed so that the source files remain usable and good examples of code instead of bad examples.  Add the ability to build source files that are in the Documentation/ dir. Add to Kconfig as "BUILD_DOCSRC" config symbol.  Use "CONFIG_BUILD_DOCSRC=1 make ..." to build objects from the Documentation/ sources.  Or enable BUILD_DOCSRC in the *config system. However, this symbol depends on HEADERS_CHECK since the header files need to be installed (for userspace builds).  Built (using cross-tools) for x86-64, i386, alpha, ia64, sparc32, sparc64, powerpc, sh, m68k, & mips.

f | driver.txt | g | 987B |  | Bernhard Walle | bwalle@suse.de | 1178565170 |  | add new_id to PCMCIA drivers  PCI drivers have the new_id file in sysfs which allows new IDs to be added at runtime.  The advantage is to avoid re-compilation of a driver that works for a new device, but it's ID table doesn't contain the new device. This mechanism is only meant for testing, after the driver has been tested successfully, the ID should be added in source code so that new revisions of the kernel automatically detect the device.  The implementation follows the PCI implementation. The interface is documented in Documentation/pcmcia/driver.txt. Computations should be done in userspace, so the sysfs string contains the raw structure members for matching.
