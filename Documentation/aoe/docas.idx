References to this file are replaced in Documentation, comments and Kconfig according to the context.  There are also some references to the old /etc/modules.conf from 2.4 kernels that are being removed.

f | udev.txt | g | 1.1K |  | Ed L. Cashin | ecashin@coraid.com | 1202491351 |  | aoe: user can ask driver to forget previously detected devices  When an AoE device is detected, the kernel is informed, and a new block device is created.  If the device is unused, the block device corresponding to remote device that is no longer available may be removed from the system by telling the aoe driver to "flush" its list of devices.  Without this patch, software like GPFS and LVM may attempt to read from AoE devices that were discovered earlier but are no longer present, blocking until the I/O attempt times out.
