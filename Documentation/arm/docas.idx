This is achieved by the MaskROM loading the first portion of the image into MERAM and then jumping to it.  This portion contains loader code which copies the entire image to SDRAM and jumps to it. From there the zImage boot code proceeds as normal, uncompressing the image into its final location and then jumping to it.

This areas is used by XScale but XScale does not have TCM so the mechanisms are mutually exclusive.  This change is needed to make TCM detection more dynamic while still being able to compile code into it, and is a must for the unified ARM goals: the current TCM allocation at different places in memory for each machine would be a nightmare if you want to compile a single image for more than one machine with TCM so it has to be nailed down in one place.

d | OMAP |  | 2 items |  | Ricardo Neri | ricardo.neri@ti.com | 1336738430 |  | OMAPDSS: Provide an interface for audio support  There exist several display technologies and standards that support audio as well. Hence, it is relevant to update the DSS device driver to provide an audio interface that may be used by an audio driver or any other driver interested in the functionality.  The audio_enable function is intended to prepare the relevant IP for playback (e.g., enabling an audio FIFO, taking in/out of reset some IP, enabling companion chips, etc). It is intended to be called before audio_start. The audio_disable function performs the reverse operation and is intended to be called after audio_stop.  While a given DSS device driver may support audio, it is possible that for certain configurations audio is not supported (e.g., an HDMI display using a VESA video timing). The audio_supported function is intended to query whether the current configuration of the display supports audio.  The audio_config function is intended to configure all the relevant audio parameters of the display. In order to make the function independent of any specific DSS device driver, a struct omap_dss_audio is defined. Its purpose is to contain all the required parameters for audio configuration. At the moment, such structure contains pointers to IEC-60958 channel status word and CEA-861 audio infoframe structures. This should be enough to support HDMI and DisplayPort, as both are based on CEA-861 and IEC-60958. The omap_dss_audio structure may be extended in the future if required.  The audio_enable/disable, audio_config and audio_supported functions could be implemented as functions that may sleep. Hence, they should not be called while holding a spinlock or a readlock.  The audio_start/audio_stop function is intended to effectively start/stop audio playback after the configuration has taken place. These functions are designed to be used in an atomic context. Hence, audio_start should return quickly and be called only after all the needed resources for audio playback (audio FIFOs, DMA channels, companion chips, etc) have been enabled to begin data transfers. audio_stop is designed to only stop the audio transfers. The resources used for playback are released using audio_disable.  A new enum omap_dss_audio_state is introduced to help the implementations of the interface to keep track of the audio state. The initial state is _DISABLED; then, the state transitions to _CONFIGURED, and then, when it is ready to play audio, to _ENABLED. The state _PLAYING is used when the audio is being rendered.

As a result, the kernel is reliant on the zImage decompressor to enter the kernel proper in the correct instruction set state.  This patch changes the boot entry protocol for head.S and Image to be the same as for zImage: in all cases, the kernel is now entered in ARM.  Documentation/arm/Booting is updated to reflect this new policy.  A different rule will be needed for Cortex-M class CPUs as and when support for those lands in mainline, since these CPUs don't support the ARM instruction set at all: a note is added to the effect that the kernel must be entered in Thumb on such systems.

This allows for VMALLOC_END to be identical across all machines.  The value for VMALLOC_END is now set to 0xff000000 which is right where the consistent DMA area starts.  To accommodate all static mappings on machines with possible highmem usage, the default vmalloc area size is changed to 240 MB so that VMALLOC_START is no higher than 0xf0000000 by default.
