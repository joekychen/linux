I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

The PORT_S3C2400 definition in include/linux/serial_core.h is left there to prevent a reuse of the same number for another port type.
