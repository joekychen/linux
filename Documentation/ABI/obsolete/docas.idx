The prototype for the old function still existed in linux/oom.h, so remove it.  There are no existing users.  Also fixes documentation and comment references to badness() and adjusts them accordingly.

Also as the actual profile is persistent, the distinction between the two was ambiguous, so both use the same code now and startup_profile has been deprecated. Also the event is now propagated through chardev. The userland tool has been updated to support this change.

The two attributes do the same thing.  It would be nice to replace power/level with a symlink to power/control, but at the moment sysfs doesn't offer any way to do so.
