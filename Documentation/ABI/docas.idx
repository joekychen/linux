It contains:     - Two patches for mtip32xx.  Killing a non-compliant sysfs interface      and moving it to debugfs, where it belongs.     - A few patches from Asias.  Two legit bug fixes, and one killing an      interface that is no longer in use.     - A patch from Jan, making the annoying partition ioctl warning a bit      less annoying, by restricting it to !CAP_SYS_RAWIO only.     - Three bug fixes for drbd from Lars Ellenberg.     - A fix for an old regression for umem, it hasn't really worked since      the plugging scheme was changed in 3.0.     - A few fixes from Tejun.     - A splice fix from Eric Dumazet, fixing an issue with pipe      resizing."  * 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.dk/linux-block:   scsi: Silence unnecessary warnings about ioctl to partition   block: Drop dead function blk_abort_queue()   block: Mitigate lock unbalance caused by lock switching   block: Avoid missed wakeup in request waitqueue   umem: fix up unplugging   splice: fix racy pipe->buffers uses   drbd: fix null pointer dereference with on-congestion policy when diskless   drbd: fix list corruption by failing but already aborted reads   drbd: fix access of unallocated pages and kernel panic   xen/blkfront: Add WARN to deal with misbehaving backends.   blkcg: drop local variable @q from blkg_destroy()   mtip32xx: Create debugfs entries for troubleshooting   mtip32xx: Remove 'registers' and 'flags' from sysfs   blkcg: fix blkg_alloc() failure path   block: blkcg_policy_cfq shouldn't be used if !CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED   block: fix return value on cfq_init() failure   mtip32xx: Remove version.h header file inclusion   xen/blkback: Copy id field when doing BLKIF_DISCARD.

d | removed |  | 6 items |  | Pablo Neira Ayuso | pablo@netfilter.org | 1336501542 |  | netfilter: remove ip_queue support  This patch removes ip_queue support which was marked as obsolete years ago. The nfnetlink_queue modules provides more advanced user-space packet queueing mechanism.  This patch also removes capability code included in SELinux that refers to ip_queue. Otherwise, we break compilation.  Several warning has been sent regarding this to the mailing list in the past month without anyone rising the hand to stop this with some strong argument.
