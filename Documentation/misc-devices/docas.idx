f | c2port.txt | g | 2.8K |  | Justin P. Mattock | justinmattock@gmail.com | 1280928100 |  | Documentation: update broken web addresses.  Below you will find an updated version from the original series bunching all patches into one big patch updating broken web addresses that are located in Documentation/* Some of the addresses date as far far back as 1995 etc... so searching became a bit difficult, the best way to deal with these is to use web.archive.org to locate these addresses that are outdated. Now there are also some addresses pointing to .spec files some are located, but some(after searching on the companies site)where still no where to be found. In this case I just changed the address to the company site this way the users can contact the company and they can locate them for the users.  Signed-off-by: Justin P.

f | max6875 | g | 3.0K |  | Jean Delvare | khali@linux-fr.org | 1254689621 |  | max6875: Discard obsolete detect method  There is no point in implementing a detect callback for the MAX6875, as this device can't be detected. It was there solely to handle "force" module parameters to instantiate devices, but now we have a better sysfs interface that can do the same.  So we can get rid of the ugly module parameters and the detect callback. This basically divides the binary module size by 2.
