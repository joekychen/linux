And 'show_sampling_rate_min' is a typo: the sysfs file is called 'sampling_rate_min'.  Signed-off-by: Paul Bolle <pebolle@tiscali.nl> Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>
f | user-guide.txt | g | 6.1K |  | Thomas Renninger | trenn@suse.de | 1259087614 |  CPU frequency and voltage scaling code in the Linux(TM) kernel | [ACPI/CPUFREQ] Introduce bios_limit per cpu cpufreq sysfs interface  This interface is mainly intended (and implemented) for ACPI _PPC BIOS frequency limitations, but other cpufreq drivers can also use it for similar use-cases.  Why is this needed:  Currently it's not obvious why cpufreq got limited. People see cpufreq/scaling_max_freq reduced, but this could have happened by:   - any userspace prog writing to scaling_max_freq   - thermal limitations   - hardware (_PPC in ACPI case) limitiations  Therefore export bios_limit (in kHz) to:   - Point the user that it's the BIOS (broken or intended) which limits     frequency   - Export it as a sysfs interface for userspace progs.     While this was a rarely used feature on laptops, there will appear     more and more server implemenations providing "Green IT" features like     allowing the service processor to limit the frequency. People want     to know about HW/BIOS frequency limitations.  All ACPI P-state driven cpufreq drivers are covered with this patch:   - powernow-k8   - powernow-k7   - acpi-cpufreq  Tested with a patched DSDT which limits the first two cores (_PPC returns 1) via _PPC, exposed by bios_limit: # echo 2200000 >cpu2/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq # cat cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq 2600000 2600000 2200000 2200000 # #scaling_max_freq shows general user/thermal/BIOS limitations  # cat cpu*/cpufreq/bios_limit 2600000 2600000 2800000 2800000 # #bios_limit only shows the HW/BIOS limitation  CC: Pallipadi Venkatesh <venkatesh.pallipadi@intel.com> CC: Len Brown <lenb@kernel.org> CC: davej@codemonkey.org.uk CC: linux@dominikbrodowski.net  Signed-off-by: Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de> Signed-off-by: Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>

f | pcc-cpufreq.txt | g | 8.3K |  | Naga Chumbalkar | nagananda.chumbalkar@hp.com | 1263398116 |  | [CPUFREQ] Processor Clocking Control interface driver  Processor Clocking Control (PCC) is an interface between the BIOS and OSPM. Based on the server workload, OSPM can request what frequency it expects from a logical CPU, and the BIOS will achieve that frequency transparently.  This patch introduces driver support for PCC. OSPM uses the PCC driver to communicate with the BIOS via the PCC interface.  There is a Documentation file that provides a link to the PCC Specification, and also provides a summary of the PCC interface.  Currently, certain HP ProLiant platforms implement the PCC interface. However, any platform whose BIOS implements the PCC Specification, can utilize this driver.  V2 --> V1 changes (based on Dominik's suggestions): - Removed the dependency on CPU_FREQ_TABLE - "cpufreq_stats" will no longer PANIC. Actually, it will not load anymore because it is not applicable. - Removed the sanity check for target frequency in the ->target routine.  NOTE: A patch to sanitize the target frequency requested by "ondemand" is needed to ensure that the target freq < policy->min.  Can this driver be queued up for the 2.6.33 tree?

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
