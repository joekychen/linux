This is the result of a  mkdir arch/powerpc/include/asm git mv include/asm-powerpc/* arch/powerpc/include/asm  Followed by a few documentation/comment fixups and a couple of places where <asm-powepc/...> was being used explicitly.  Of the latter only one was outside the arch code and it is a driver only built for powerpc.  Signed-off-by: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@canb.auug.org.au> Signed-off-by: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>

We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
