These broken references are caused by typo's in the references, and by renames or removals of the Documentation files. Some broken references are simply odd.  Fix these broken references, sometimes by dropping the irrelevant text they were part of.  Signed-off-by: Paul Bolle <pebolle@tiscali.nl> Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>

VERBOSE_IDE_CD_ERRORS has been replace by config option CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD_VERBOSE_ERRORS.  STANDARD_ATAPI is no longer needed, since the non-standard drivers, which required bcd2bin are now detected, and there's a flag for them.  NO_DOOR_LOCKING is now a sysctl parameter for cdrom drivers.  CDROM_NBLOCKS_BUFFER is not used anymore. The READAUDIO is now in cdrom.c and it allocates as much as user space has requested to read, backing off if it fails.  TEST is not there anymore or in cdrom either. ide allows to send ATA commands through ioctl, although it may be helpful to send MMC packets through the cdrom layer directly.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

Make it return void and update all callers that check the return value.
