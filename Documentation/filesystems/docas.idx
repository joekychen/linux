f | adfs.txt | g | 2.6K |  | Stuart Swales | stuart.swales.croftnuisk@gmail.com | 1300841057 |  | adfs: add hexadecimal filetype suffix option  ADFS (FileCore) storage complies with the RISC OS filetype specification (12 bits of file type information is stored in the file load address, rather than using a file extension).  The existing driver largely ignores this information and does not present it to the end user.  It is desirable that stored filetypes be made visible to the end user to facilitate a precise copy of data and metadata from a hard disc (or image thereof) into a RISC OS emulator (such as RPCEmu) or to a network share which can be accessed by real Acorn systems.  This patch implements a per-mount filetype suffix option (use -o ftsuffix=1) to present any filetype as a ,xyz hexadecimal suffix on each file.  This type suffix is compatible with that used by RISC OS systems that access network servers using NFS client software and by RPCemu's host filing system.

UFS2 - is default file system for recent versions of FreeBSD.  The main differences from UFS1 from write support point of view are: 1)Not all inodes are allocated during formatation of disk. 2)All meta-data(pointer to data blocks) are 64bit(in UFS1 they are 32bit).  So patch series consist of 1)make possible mount UFS2 in read-write mode 2)code to write ufs2 inodes and code to initialize inodes chunks. 3)work with 64bit meta-data  I made simple testing like create/deleting/writing/reading/truncating, also I ran fsx-linux and untar and build kernel on UFS1 and UFS2, after that FreeBSD fsck do not find any errors in fs.  This patch makes possible to mount ufs2 "rw", and updates UFS2 documentation: remove note about bug(it fixed by reallocate blocks on the fly patch) and add me in the list of people who want receive bug reports.

f | files.txt | g | 4.1K |  | David Howells | dhowells@redhat.com | 1329676252 |  | Wrap accesses to the fd_sets in struct fdtable  Wrap accesses to the fd_sets in struct fdtable (for recording open files and close-on-exec flags) so that we can move away from using fd_sets since we abuse the fd_set structs by not allocating the full-sized structure under normal circumstances and by non-core code looking at the internals of the fd_sets.  The first abuse means that use of FD_ZERO() on these fd_sets is not permitted, since that cannot be told about their abnormal lengths.  This introduces six wrapper functions for setting, clearing and testing close-on-exec flags and fd-is-open flags:  	void __set_close_on_exec(int fd, struct fdtable *fdt); 	void __clear_close_on_exec(int fd, struct fdtable *fdt); 	bool close_on_exec(int fd, const struct fdtable *fdt); 	void __set_open_fd(int fd, struct fdtable *fdt); 	void __clear_open_fd(int fd, struct fdtable *fdt); 	bool fd_is_open(int fd, const struct fdtable *fdt);  Note that I've prepended '__' to the names of the set/clear functions because they require the caller to hold a lock to use them.  Note also that I haven't added wrappers for looking behind the scenes at the the array.  Possibly that should exist too.

It uses hash tables with unordered, unbounded lists in each bucket for directories, extents for data blocks, 64-bit addressing for blocks, with up to 8K blocks (only 2K of a given block is ever used for metadata, so the FS still works with 4K pages).

f | ubifs.txt | g | 5.1K |  | Artem Bityutskiy | Artem.Bityutskiy@nokia.com | 1309766068 |  | UBIFS: switch self-check knobs to debugfs  UBIFS has many built-in self-check functions which can be enabled using the debug_chks module parameter or the corresponding sysfs file (/sys/module/ubifs/parameters/debug_chks). However, this is not flexible enough because it is not per-filesystem. This patch moves this to debugfs interfaces.  We already have debugfs support, so this patch just adds more debugfs files. While looking at debugfs support I've noticed that it is racy WRT file-system unmount, and added a TODO entry for that. This problem has been there for long time and it is quite standard debugfs PITA. The plan is to fix this later.  This patch is simple, but it is large because it changes many places where we check if a particular type of checks is enabled or disabled.
