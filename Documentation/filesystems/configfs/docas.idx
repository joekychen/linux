f | Makefile | g | 100B |  | Randy Dunlap | randy.dunlap@oracle.com | 1218582450 |  | docsrc: build Documentation/ sources  Currently source files in the Documentation/ sub-dir can easily bit-rot since they are not generally buildable, either because they are hidden in text files or because there are no Makefile rules for them.  This needs to be fixed so that the source files remain usable and good examples of code instead of bad examples.  Add the ability to build source files that are in the Documentation/ dir. Add to Kconfig as "BUILD_DOCSRC" config symbol.  Use "CONFIG_BUILD_DOCSRC=1 make ..." to build objects from the Documentation/ sources.  Or enable BUILD_DOCSRC in the *config system. However, this symbol depends on HEADERS_CHECK since the header files need to be installed (for userspace builds).  Built (using cross-tools) for x86-64, i386, alpha, ia64, sparc32, sparc64, powerpc, sh, m68k, & mips.
