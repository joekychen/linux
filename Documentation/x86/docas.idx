The "initrd=" option in particular is tricky because it only understands absolute EFI-style paths (backslashes as directory separators), and until now this hasn't been documented anywhere. This has tripped up a couple of users.

OFW remains resident in memory, living within virtual range 0xff800000 - 0xffc00000.  A single page directory entry points to the pgdir that OFW actually uses, so rather than saving the entire page table, we grab and install that one entry permanently in the kernel's page table.  This is currently only used by the OLPC XO.  Note that this particular calling convention breaks PAE and PAT, and so cannot be used on newer x86 hardware.
