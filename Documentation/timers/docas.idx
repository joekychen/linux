f | highres.txt | g | 12K |  | Paul Bolle | pebolle@tiscali.nl | 1317139684 |  | doc: fix broken references  There are numerous broken references to Documentation files (in other Documentation files, in comments, etc.). These broken references are caused by typo's in the references, and by renames or removals of the Documentation files. Some broken references are simply odd.  Fix these broken references, sometimes by dropping the irrelevant text they were part of.  Signed-off-by: Paul Bolle <pebolle@tiscali.nl> Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>
