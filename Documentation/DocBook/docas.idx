I am also working on the acceptance for an TI OMAP one, based on a   compatible legacy version of the interface called SSI."  Ok, so it didn't get into 3.3, but here it is pulled into 3.4.

A quick search on the internet, and you see that even the MCA hobbyist/enthusiast community has lost interest in the early 2000 era and never really even moved ahead from the 2.4 kernels to the 2.6 series.  This deletes anything remaining related to CONFIG_MCA from core kernel code and from the x86 architecture.  There is no point in carrying this any further into the future.
