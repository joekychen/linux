f | ca.xml | g | 6.2K |  | Mauro Carvalho Chehab | mchehab@redhat.com | 1311800017 |  | [media] DVB: Point to the generic error chapter  Just like the V4L, MC and LIRC API's, point to the generic error chapter for ioctl's. This will allow moving generic error codes to just one place inside all media API's.  A latter patch will remove the generic errors from each specific ioctl.

Due to the way cleandocs target works, I had to rename the media DocBook to media_api, otherwise cleandocs would remove the /media directory.

Still, better to remove a few warnings about the missing symbols. So, add the net data structure inside the net.xml. Now, only the ioctl documentation is missed.

Such API is not documented at all. Also, the osd.h API uses camelCase and some other weird stuff. Also, dvb-core doesn't recognize it.  I don't see any good reason why we should document it. It seems better to just let it as-is. If ever needed, it is probably better to write a different API for dvb-core.  Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>
