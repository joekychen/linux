Normally, macro isn't recommended as it's type-unsafe and making debugging harder as symbol cannot be passed throught to the debugger.  Quote from Johannes " Hmm, it would probably be cleaner to fully convert the isolation mode into independent flags.  INACTIVE, ACTIVE, BOTH is currently a tri-state among flags, which is a bit ugly."  This patch moves isolate mode from swap.h to mmzone.h by memcontrol.h  Signed-off-by: Minchan Kim <minchan.kim@gmail.com> Cc: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org> Cc: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com> Cc: KOSAKI Motohiro <kosaki.motohiro@jp.fujitsu.com> Cc: Mel Gorman <mgorman@suse.de> Cc: Rik van Riel <riel@redhat.com> Cc: Michal Hocko <mhocko@suse.cz> Cc: Andrea Arcangeli <aarcange@redhat.com> Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org> Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

So, let's name it properly.  For pages freed via page-list we also trigger mm_page_free_batched event.
