The exact warning message is: 	warning: (UPROBE_EVENT) selects UPROBES which has unmet direct dependencies (UPROBE_EVENTS && PERF_EVENTS)  This is due to a typo in arch/Kconfig file. Fix similar typos in the uprobetracer documentation.  Also add sample format of a uprobe event in the uprobetracer documentation as suggested by Masami Hiramatsu.

This also enables user to set a probe on a function on a specific module, even if a same name (but different) function is locally defined in another module.

For example, symbols on PPC64 start with a period and the generic code will fail to match them.  This patch moves the match logic out into a separate function which an arch can override by defining ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_MATCH_SYM_NAME in asm/ftrace.h and implementing arch_syscall_match_sym_name.

f | function-graph-fold.vim | g | 1.3K |  | Josh Triplett | josh@joshtriplett.org | 1251261124 |  | tracing: Add vim script to enable folding for function_graph traces  function_graph traces look like nested function calls, complete with braces denoting the start and end of functions.  function-graph-fold.vim teaches vim how to fold these functions, to make it more convenient to browse them.  To use, :source function-graph-fold.vim while viewing a function_graph trace, or use "view -S function-graph-fold.vim some-trace" to load it from the command-line together with a trace.  You can then use the usual vim fold commands, such as "za", to open and close nested functions. While closed, a fold will show the total time taken for a call, as would normally appear on the line with the closing brace.  Folded functions will not include finish_task_switch(), so folding should remain relatively sane even through a context switch.  Note that this will almost certainly only work well with a single-CPU trace (e.g. trace-cmd report --cpu 1).  It also takes some time to run (a few seconds for a large trace on my laptop).  Nevertheless, I found it very handy to get an overview of a trace and then drill down on problematic calls.
