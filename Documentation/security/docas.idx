f | keys.txt | g | 49K |  | David Howells | dhowells@redhat.com | 1336730216 |  | KEYS: Add invalidation support  Add support for invalidating a key - which renders it immediately invisible to further searches and causes the garbage collector to immediately wake up, remove it from keyrings and then destroy it when it's no longer referenced.  It's better not to do this with keyctl_revoke() as that marks the key to start returning -EKEYREVOKED to searches when what is actually desired is to have the key refetched.  To invalidate a key the caller must be granted SEARCH permission by the key. This may be too strict.  It may be better to also permit invalidation if the caller has any of READ, WRITE or SETATTR permission.  The primary use for this is to evict keys that are cached in special keyrings, such as the DNS resolver or an ID mapper.  Signed-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

f | Smack.txt | g | 26K |  | Casey Schaufler | casey@schaufler-ca.com | 1337060918 |  | Smack: allow for significantly longer Smack labels v4  V4 updated to current linux-security#next Targeted for git://gitorious.org/smack-next/kernel.git  Modern application runtime environments like to use naming schemes that are structured and generated without human intervention. Even though the Smack limit of 23 characters for a label name is perfectly rational for human use there have been complaints that the limit is a problem in environments where names are composed from a set or sources, including vendor, author, distribution channel and application name. Names like  	softwarehouse-pgwodehouse-coolappstore-mellowmuskrats  are becoming harder to avoid. This patch introduces long label support in Smack. Labels are now limited to 255 characters instead of the old 23.  The primary reason for limiting the labels to 23 characters was so they could be directly contained in CIPSO category sets. This is still done were possible, but for labels that are too large a mapping is required. This is perfectly safe for communication that stays "on the box" and doesn't require much coordination between boxes beyond what would have been required to keep label names consistent.  The bulk of this patch is in smackfs, adding and updating administrative interfaces. Because existing APIs can't be changed new ones that do much the same things as old ones have been introduced.  The Smack specific CIPSO data representation has been removed and replaced with the data format used by netlabel. The CIPSO header is now computed when a label is imported rather than on use. This results in improved IP performance. The smack label is now allocated separately from the containing structure, allowing for larger strings.  Four new /smack interfaces have been introduced as four of the old interfaces strictly required labels be specified in fixed length arrays.  The access interface is supplemented with the check interface: 	access  "Subject                 Object                  rwxat" 	access2 "Subject Object rwaxt"  The load interface is supplemented with the rules interface: 	load   "Subject                 Object                  rwxat" 	load2  "Subject Object rwaxt"  The load-self interface is supplemented with the self-rules interface: 	load-self   "Subject                 Object                  rwxat" 	load-self2  "Subject Object rwaxt"  The cipso interface is supplemented with the wire interface: 	cipso  "Subject                  lvl cnt  c1  c2 ..." 	cipso2 "Subject lvl cnt  c1  c2 ..."  The old interfaces are maintained for compatibility.  Signed-off-by: Casey Schaufler <casey@schaufler-ca.com>
