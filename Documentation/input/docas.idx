f | gpio-tilt.txt | g | 2.5K |  | Heiko St√ºbner | heiko@sntech.de | 1322725276 |  | Input: add generic GPIO-tilt driver  There exist tilt switches that simply report their tilt-state via some gpios. The number and orientation of their axes can vary depending on the switch used and the build of the device. Also two or more one-axis switches could be combined to provide multi-dimensional orientation.  One example of a device using such a switch is the family of Qisda ebook readers, where the switch provides information about the landscape / portrait orientation of the device. The example in Documentation/input/gpio-tilt.txt documents exactly this one-axis device.  Signed-off-by: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de> Signed-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dtor@mail.ru>
