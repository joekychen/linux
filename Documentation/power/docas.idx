Wysocki | rjw@sisk.pl | 1324501265 |  | PM: Run the driver callback directly if the subsystem one is not there  Make the PM core execute driver PM callbacks directly if the corresponding subsystem callbacks are not present.  There are three reasons for doing that.  First, it reflects the behavior of drivers/base/dd.c:really_probe() that runs the driver's .probe() callback directly if the bus type's one is not defined, so this change will remove one arbitrary difference between the PM core and the remaining parts of the driver core.  Second, it will allow some subsystems, whose PM callbacks don't do anything except for executing driver callbacks, to be simplified quite a bit by removing those "forward-only" callbacks.  Finally, it will allow us to remove one level of indirection in the system suspend and resume code paths where it is not necessary, which is going to lead to less debug noise with initcall_debug passed in the kernel command line (messages won't be printed for driverless devices whose subsystems don't provide PM callbacks among other things).

f | devices.txt | g | 34K |  | Rafael J. Wysocki | rjw@sisk.pl | 1327865909 |  | PM / Sleep: Introduce "late suspend" and "early resume" of devices  The current device suspend/resume phases during system-wide power transitions appear to be insufficient for some platforms that want to use the same callback routines for saving device states and related operations during runtime suspend/resume as well as during system suspend/resume.  In principle, they could point their .suspend_noirq() and .resume_noirq() to the same callback routines as their .runtime_suspend() and .runtime_resume(), respectively, but at least some of them require device interrupts to be enabled while the code in those routines is running.  It also makes sense to have device suspend-resume callbacks that will be executed with runtime PM disabled and with device interrupts enabled in case someone needs to run some special code in that context during system-wide power transitions.  Apart from this, .suspend_noirq() and .resume_noirq() were introduced as a workaround for drivers using shared interrupts and failing to prevent their interrupt handlers from accessing suspended hardware. It appears to be better not to use them for other porposes, or we may have to deal with some serious confusion (which seems to be happening already).  For the above reasons, introduce new device suspend/resume phases, "late suspend" and "early resume" (and analogously for hibernation) whose callback will be executed with runtime PM disabled and with device interrupts enabled and whose callback pointers generally may point to runtime suspend/resume routines.

f | notifiers.txt | g | 2.7K |  | Rafael J. Wysocki | rjw@sisk.pl | 1305667560 |  | PM: Allow drivers to allocate memory from .prepare() callbacks safely  If device drivers allocate substantial amounts of memory (above 1 MB) in their hibernate .freeze() callbacks (or in their legacy suspend callbcks during hibernation), the subsequent creation of hibernate image may fail due to the lack of memory.  This is the case, because the drivers' .freeze() callbacks are executed after the hibernate memory preallocation has been carried out and the preallocated amount of memory may be too small to cover the new driver allocations. Unfortunately, the drivers' .prepare() callbacks also are executed after the hibernate memory preallocation has completed, so they are not suitable for allocating additional memory either.  Thus the only way a driver can safely allocate memory during hibernation is to use a hibernate/suspend notifier.  However, the notifiers are called before the freezing of user space and the drivers wanting to use them for allocating additional memory may not know how much memory needs to be allocated at that point.  To let device drivers overcome this difficulty rework the hibernation sequence so that the memory preallocation is carried out after the drivers' .prepare() callbacks have been executed, so that the .prepare() callbacks can be used for allocating additional memory to be used by the drivers' .freeze() callbacks.  Update documentation to match the new behavior of the code.  Signed-off-by: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
