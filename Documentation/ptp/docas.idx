This patch adds an infrastructure for hardware clocks that implement IEEE 1588, the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). A class driver offers a registration method to particular hardware clock drivers. Each clock is presented as a standard POSIX clock.  The ancillary clock features are exposed in two different ways, via the sysfs and by a character device.
