This patch enables DIPM when the user sets the link power management policy to "min_power".  Additionally, libata drivers can define a function (enable_pm) that will perform hardware specific actions to enable whatever power management policy the user set up for Host Initiated Power management (HIPM). This power management policy will be activated after all disks have been enumerated and intialized.  Drivers should also define disable_pm, which will turn off link power management, but not change link power management policy.

f | st.txt | g | 24K |  | Lee Duncan | lduncan@suse.com | 1332833194 |  | [SCSI] st: expand ability to write immediate filemarks  The st tape driver recently added the MTWEOFI ioctl, which writes a tape filemark (EOF), like the MTWEOF ioctl, except that MTWEOFI returns immediately. This makes certain applications, like backup software, run much more quickly on buffered tape drives.  Since legacy applications do not know about this new MTWEOFI ioctl, this patch adds a new ioctl option that tells the st driver to return immediately when writing an EOF (i.e. a filemark). This new flag is much like the existing flag that tells the st driver to perform writes (and certain other IOs) immediately, but this new flag only applies to writing EOFs.  This new feature is controlled via the MTSETDRVBUFFER ioctl, using the newly-defined MT_ST_NOWAIT_EOF flag.  Use of this new feature is displayed via the sysfs tape "options" attribute.  The st documentation was updated to mention this new flag, as well as the problems that can occur from using it.

f | Mylex.txt | g | 311B |  | Justin P. Mattock | justinmattock@gmail.com | 1280928100 |  | Documentation: update broken web addresses.  Below you will find an updated version from the original series bunching all patches into one big patch updating broken web addresses that are located in Documentation/* Some of the addresses date as far far back as 1995 etc... so searching became a bit difficult, the best way to deal with these is to use web.archive.org to locate these addresses that are outdated. Now there are also some addresses pointing to .spec files some are located, but some(after searching on the companies site)where still no where to be found. In this case I just changed the address to the company site this way the users can contact the company and they can locate them for the users.  Signed-off-by: Justin P.

f | LICENSE.FlashPoint | g | 2.6K |  | Linus Torvalds | torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org | 1113690036 |  | Linux-2.6.12-rc2  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
