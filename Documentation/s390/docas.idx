Somehow a few bits got upstream anyway. Since kerntypes aren't used anymore and lcrash isn't maintained (for s390 at least) remove the last traces of kerntypes that somehow went upstream. Also remove the documentation that mentions lcrash.  Signed-off-by: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com> Signed-off-by: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>

We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.

f | zfcpdump.txt | g | 3.7K |  | Michael Holzheu | holzheu@de.ibm.com | 1177682504 |  | [S390] zfcpdump support.  s390 machines provide hardware support for creating Linux dumps on SCSI disks. For creating a dump a special purpose dump Linux is used. The first 32 MB of memory are saved by the hardware before the dump Linux is booted. Via an SCLP interface, the saved memory can be accessed from Linux. This patch exports memory and registers of the crashed Linux to userspace via a debugfs file. For more information refer to Documentation/s390/zfcpdump.txt, which is included in this patch.
