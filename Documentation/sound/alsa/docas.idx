It gives the number of channels to be used, "2ch", "4ch" abd "6ch".   According to the configuration, this also controls the   jack-retasking of multi-I/O jacks.  * Independent HP   When this enum control is enabled, the headphone output is routed   from an individual stream (the third PCM such as hw:0,2) instead of   the primary stream.
