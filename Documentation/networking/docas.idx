f | openvswitch.txt | g | 8.7K |  | Jesse Gross | jesse@nicira.com | 1322933717 |  | net: Add Open vSwitch kernel components.  Open vSwitch is a multilayer Ethernet switch targeted at virtualized environments.  In addition to supporting a variety of features expected in a traditional hardware switch, it enables fine-grained programmatic extension and flow-based control of the network. This control is useful in a wide variety of applications but is particularly important in multi-server virtualization deployments, which are often characterized by highly dynamic endpoints and the need to maintain logical abstractions for multiple tenants.  The Open vSwitch datapath provides an in-kernel fast path for packet forwarding.  It is complemented by a userspace daemon, ovs-vswitchd, which is able to accept configuration from a variety of sources and translate it into packet processing rules.  See http://openvswitch.org for more information and userspace utilities.  Signed-off-by: Jesse Gross <jesse@nicira.com>

Its documentation specified that these flags could be accessed from user space via SIOCGIFFLAGS.  However, this does not work because the new flags do not fit in that ioctl's argument width.  Change the documentation to match the code's behavior.  Also change the source to explicitly show the truncation.  This _should_ have no effect on executable code, and did not with gcc 4.2.4 generating x86 code.  A new ioctl could be defined to return all interface flags to user space.  However, since this has been broken for three years with no one complaining, there doesn't seem much need.  They are still accessible via netlink.

f | team.txt | g | 109B |  | Jiri Pirko | jpirko@redhat.com | 1321218610 |  | net: introduce ethernet teaming device  This patch introduces new network device called team. It supposes to be very fast, simple, userspace-driven alternative to existing bonding driver.  Userspace library called libteam with couple of demo apps is available here: https://github.com/jpirko/libteam Note it's still in its dipers atm.  team<->libteam use generic netlink for communication. That and rtnl suppose to be the only way to configure team device, no sysfs etc.  Python binding of libteam was recently introduced. Daemon providing arpmon/miimon active-backup functionality will be introduced shortly. All what's necessary is already implemented in kernel team driver.  v7->v8: 	- check ndo_ndo_vlan_rx_[add/kill]_vid functions before calling 	  them. 	- use dev_kfree_skb_any() instead of dev_kfree_skb()  v6->v7: 	- transmit and receive functions are not checked in hot paths. 	  That also resolves memory leak on transmit when no port is 	  present  v5->v6: 	- changed couple of _rcu calls to non _rcu ones in non-readers  v4->v5: 	- team_change_mtu() uses team->lock while travesing though port 	  list 	- mac address changes are moved completely to jurisdiction of 	  userspace daemon. This way the daemon can do FOM1, FOM2 and 	  possibly other weird things with mac addresses. 	  Only round-robin mode sets up all ports to bond's address then 	  enslaved. 	- Extended Kconfig text  v3->v4: 	- remove redundant synchronize_rcu from __team_change_mode() 	- revert "set and clear of mode_ops happens per pointer, not per 	  byte" 	- extend comment of function __team_change_mode()  v2->v3: 	- team_change_mtu() uses rcu version of list traversal to unwind 	- set and clear of mode_ops happens per pointer, not per byte 	- port hashlist changed to be embedded into team structure 	- error branch in team_port_enter() does cleanup now 	- fixed rtln->rtnl  v1->v2: 	- modes are made as modules. Makes team more modular and 	  extendable. 	- several commenters' nitpicks found on v1 were fixed 	- several other bugs were fixed. 	- note I ignored Eric's comment about roundrobin port selector 	  as Eric's way may be easily implemented as another mode (mode 	  "random") in future.

There is a concurrent effort underway to get the iSCSI driver (qla4xxx) integrated upstream as well.  I have been through several iterations with the linux-netdev list and have had much response from Stephen Hemminger.  - Built and tested using kernel 2.6.17-rc4.  - The chip supports two ethernet and two iSCSI functions.  - The functions ql_sem_lock, ql_sem_spinlock, ql_sem_unlock, and   ql_wait_for_drvr_lock are used to protect resources that are shared across   the network and iSCSI functions.  This protection is mostly during chip   initialization and resets, but also include link management.  - The PHY/MII are not exported through ethtool due to the fact that the   iSCSI function will control the common link at least 50% of the time.  This driver has been through several iterations on the netdev list and we feel this driver is ready for inclusion in the upstream kernel.  It has been built and tested on x86 and PPC64 platforms.

The new file has my copyright since I designed and implemented the ppp_generic interface in the late 1990s. None of the contents of this file comes from the original if_ppp.h published by Carnegie Mellon University.  Of the remainder of if_ppp.h, only the PPP_MTU definition was being used, and this replaces the uses of it with PPP_MRU (which is identical). Therefore, this replaces the entire file with the single line  #include <linux/ppp-ioctl.h>  which clearly doesn't contain any CMU code.  Thus I have removed the CMU copyright notice with its problematic advertising clause, and in fact since it's only one trivial line I have not added any other copyright notice.
