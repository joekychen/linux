In addition, add a pointer to more hwsim test cases in hostap.git.  Signed-off-by: Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi> Signed-off-by: John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>

It can be used to test most of the mac80211 functionality and user space tools (e.g., hostapd and wpa_supplicant) in a way that matches very closely with the normal case of using real WLAN hardware. From the mac80211 view point, mac80211_hwsim is yet another hardware driver, i.e., no changes to mac80211 are needed to use this testing tool.
