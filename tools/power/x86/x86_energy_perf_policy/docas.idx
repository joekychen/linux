f | Makefile | g | 197B |  | Len Brown | len.brown@intel.com | 1294804941 |  | tools: create power/x86/x86_energy_perf_policy  MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS first became available on Westmere Xeon. It is implemented in all Sandy Bridge processors -- mobile, desktop and server. It is expected to become increasingly important in subsequent generations.  x86_energy_perf_policy is a user-space utility to set the hardware energy vs performance policy hint in the processor. Most systems would benefit from "x86_energy_perf_policy normal" at system startup, as the hardware default is maximum performance at the expense of energy efficiency.  See x86_energy_perf_policy.8 man page for more information.  Background:  Linux-2.6.36 added "epb" to /proc/cpuinfo to indicate if an x86 processor supports MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS, without actually modifying the MSR.  In March, 2010, Venkatesh Pallipadi proposed a small driver that programmed MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS, based on the cpufreq governor in use.  It also offered a boot-time cmdline option to override. http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/3/4/457 But hiding the hardware policy behind the governor choice was deemed "kinda icky".  In June, 2010, I proposed a generic user/kernel API to generalize the power/performance policy trade-off. "RFC: /sys/power/policy_preference" http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/6/16/399 That is my preference for implementing this capability, but I received no support on the list.  So in September, 2010, I sent x86_energy_perf_policy.c to LKML, a user-space utility that scribbles directly to the MSR. http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/28/246  Here is that same utility, after responding to some review feedback, to live in tools/power/, where it is easily found.
