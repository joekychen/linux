f | Makefile | g | 425B |  | Frederic Weisbecker | fweisbec@gmail.com | 1332980077 |  | selftests: launch individual selftests from the main Makefile  Remove the run_tests script and launch the selftests by calling "make run_tests" from the selftests top directory instead.  This delegates to the Makefile in each selftest directory, where it is decided how to launch the local test.  This removes the need to add each selftest directory to the now removed "run_tests" top script.

f | breakpoint_test.c | s | 7.2K | 332 | Frederic Weisbecker | fweisbec@gmail.com | 1326427992 |  | selftests: new x86 breakpoints selftest  Bring a first selftest in the relevant directory.  This tests several combinations of breakpoints and watchpoints in x86, as well as icebp traps and int3 traps.  Given the amount of breakpoint regressions we raised after we merged the generic breakpoint infrastructure, such selftest became necessary and can still serve today as a basis for new patches that touch the do_debug() path.
