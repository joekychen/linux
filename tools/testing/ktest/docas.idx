This is usually the case, and to allow the user to do so, which is helpful if the user is creating different min configs based on tests, and they know one is a superset of another test, they can set USE_OUTPUT_MIN_CONFIG to one, which will prevent kest.pl from prompting to use the OUTPUT_MIN_CONFIG and it will just use it.  If USE_OUTPUT_MIN_CONIFG is set to zero, then ktest.pl will continue to use MIN_CONFIG instead.  The default is that USE_OUTPUT_MIN_CONFIG is undefined.

f | compare-ktest-sample.pl | s | 524B | 28 | Steven Rostedt | srostedt@redhat.com | 1324609619 |  | ktest: Fix compare script to test if options are not documented  The compare script compare-ktest-sample.pl checks for options that are defined in ktest.pl and not documented in samples.conf, as well as samples in samples.conf that are not used in ktest.pl.  With the switch to the hash format to initialize the ktest variables the compare script needs to be updated to handle the change.  Signed-off-by: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>
