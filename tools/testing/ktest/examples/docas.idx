I've been asked to included that config in the ktest repository.  Here it is.  Signed-off-by: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>
f | crosstests.conf | g | 7.0K |  | Steven Rostedt | srostedt@redhat.com | 1337659860 |  | ktest: Add an example config that does cross compiling of several archs  Add the config that I use to test several archs. I downloaded several cross compilers from:   http://kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/files/bin/x86_64/  and this config is an example to crosscompile several archs to make sure that your changes do not break archs that you are not working on.

f | test.conf | g | 2.0K |  | Steven Rostedt | srostedt@redhat.com | 1337659710 |  | ktest: Add useful example configs  I've been asked several times to provide more useful example configs for ktest.pl, as the sample.conf is too complex (because it explains all configs). This adds configs broken up by use case, and these configs are based on actual configs that I use on a daily basis.  Signed-off-by: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>
