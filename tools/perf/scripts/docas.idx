d | python |  | 11 items |  | Neil Horman | nhorman@tuxdriver.com | 1317325297 |  | perf script: Add drop monitor script  A while back I created the dropmonitor protocol, which allowed users to get reports of dropped frames communicated to them via a netlink socket.  While useful, several people have now asked that I integrate the ability to do drop monitoring with perf, so they don't have to run additional tools.  This patch adds a drop monitor script to the perf suite, and provides the same output that the netlink socket does.
