f | header.c | s | 858B | 28 | Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo | acme@redhat.com | 1331739379 |  | perf tools: Use scnprintf where applicable  Several places were expecting that the value returned was the number of characters printed, not what would be printed if there was space.  Fix it by using the scnprintf and vscnprintf variants we inherited from the kernel sources.  Some corner cases where the number of printed characters were not accounted were fixed too.
