f | hppfs.c | s | 16K | 642 | Jan Kara | jack@suse.cz | 1336283021 |  | vfs: Rename end_writeback() to clear_inode()  After we moved inode_sync_wait() from end_writeback() it doesn't make sense to call the function end_writeback() anymore. Rename it to clear_inode() which well says what the function really does - set I_CLEAR flag.  Signed-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz> Signed-off-by: Fengguang Wu <fengguang.wu@intel.com>
