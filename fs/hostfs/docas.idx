Rename it to clear_inode() which well says what the function really does - set I_CLEAR flag.  Signed-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz> Signed-off-by: Fengguang Wu <fengguang.wu@intel.com>

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
