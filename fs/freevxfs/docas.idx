f | vxfs.h | s | 9.1K | 236 | Theodore Ts'o | tytso@mit.edu | 1159370777 |  | [PATCH] inode_diet: Replace inode.u.generic_ip with inode.i_private  The following patches reduce the size of the VFS inode structure by 28 bytes on a UP x86.  (It would be more on an x86_64 system).  This is a 10% reduction in the inode size on a UP kernel that is configured in a production mode (i.e., with no spinlock or other debugging functions enabled; if you want to save memory taken up by in-core inodes, the first thing you should do is disable the debugging options; they are responsible for a huge amount of bloat in the VFS inode structure).  This patch:  The filesystem or device-specific pointer in the inode is inside a union, which is pretty pointless given that all 30+ users of this field have been using the void pointer.  Get rid of the union and rename it to i_private, with a comment to explain who is allowed to use the void pointer.  This is just a cleanup, but it allows us to reuse the union 'u' for something something where the union will actually be used.
