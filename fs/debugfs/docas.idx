f | inode.c | s | 17K | 605 | Ludwig Nussel | ludwig.nussel@suse.de | 1327606129 |  | debugfs: add mode, uid and gid options  Cautious admins may want to restrict access to debugfs. Currently a manual chown/chmod e.g. in an init script is needed to achieve that. Distributions that want to make the mount options configurable need to add extra config files. By allowing to set the root inode's uid, gid and mode via mount options no such hacks are needed anymore. Instead configuration becomes straight forward via fstab.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
