f | dnotify.c | s | 11K | 353 | Eric Paris | eparis@redhat.com | 1280326735 |  | fanotify: use both marks when possible  fanotify currently, when given a vfsmount_mark will look up (if it exists) the corresponding inode mark.  This patch drops that lookup and uses the mark provided.  Signed-off-by: Eric Paris <eparis@redhat.com>
f | Kconfig | g | 315B |  | Eric Paris | eparis@redhat.com | 1248204386 |  | fsnotify: use def_bool in kconfig instead of letting the user choose  fsnotify doens't give the user anything.  If someone chooses inotify or dnotify it should build fsnotify, if they don't select one it shouldn't be built.  This patch changes fsnotify to be a def_bool=n and makes everything else select it.  Also fixes the issue people complained about on lwn where gdm hung because they didn't have inotify and they didn't get the inotify build option.....  Signed-off-by: Eric Paris <eparis@redhat.com>
f | Makefile | g | 36B |  | Eric Paris | eparis@redhat.com | 1230764863 |  | filesystem notification: create fs/notify to contain all fs notification  Creating a generic filesystem notification interface, fsnotify, which will be used by inotify, dnotify, and eventually fanotify is really starting to clutter the fs directory.  This patch simply moves inotify and dnotify into fs/notify/inotify and fs/notify/dnotify respectively to make both current fs/ and future notification tidier.
