I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

f | file.c | s | 6.7K | 262 | Josef Bacik | josef@redhat.com | 1338566845 |  | fs: introduce inode operation ->update_time  Btrfs has to make sure we have space to allocate new blocks in order to modify the inode, so updating time can fail.  We've gotten around this by having our own file_update_time but this is kind of a pain, and Christoph has indicated he would like to make xfs do something different with atime updates.  So introduce ->update_time, where we will deal with i_version an a/m/c time updates and indicate which changes need to be made.  The normal version just does what it has always done, updates the time and marks the inode dirty, and then filesystems can choose to do something different.  I've gone through all of the users of file_update_time and made them check for errors with the exception of the fault code since it's complicated and I wasn't quite sure what to do there, also Jan is going to be pushing the file time updates into page_mkwrite for those who have it so that should satisfy btrfs and make it not a big deal to check the file_update_time() return code in the generic fault path.
