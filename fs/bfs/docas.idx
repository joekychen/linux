Rename it to clear_inode() which well says what the function really does - set I_CLEAR flag.  Signed-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz> Signed-off-by: Fengguang Wu <fengguang.wu@intel.com>

f | bfs.h | s | 1.3K | 48 | Artem Bityutskiy | Artem.Bityutskiy@nokia.com | 1281386933 |  | BFS: clean up the superblock usage  BFS is a very simple FS and its superblocks contains only static information and is never changed. However, the BFS code for some misterious reasons marked its buffer head as dirty from time to time, but nothing in that buffer was ever changed.  This patch removes all the BFS superblock manipulation, simply because it is not needed. It removes:  1. The si_sbh filed from 'struct bfs_sb_info' because it is not    needed. We only need to read the SB once on mount to get the    start of data blocks and the FS size. After this, we can forget    about the SB. 2. All instances of 'mark_buffer_dirty(sbh)' for BFS SB because    it is never changed. 3. The '->sync_fs()' method because there is nothing to sync    (inodes are synched by VFS). 4. The '->write_super()' method, again, because the SB is never    changed.

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
