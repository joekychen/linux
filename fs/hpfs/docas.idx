I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!

"A lot of misc stuff.  The obvious groups:    * Miklos' atomic_open series; kills the damn abuse of      ->d_revalidate() by NFS, which was the major stumbling block for      all work in that area.    * ripping security_file_mmap() and dealing with deadlocks in the      area; sanitizing the neighborhood of vm_mmap()/vm_munmap() in      general.    * ->encode_fh() switched to saner API; insane fake dentry in      mm/cleancache.c gone.    * assorted annotations in fs (endianness, __user)    * parts of Artem's ->s_dirty work (jff2 and reiserfs parts)    * ->update_time() work from Josef.    * other bits and pieces all over the place.    Normally it would've been in two or three pull requests, but   signal.git stuff had eaten a lot of time during this cycle ;-/"  Fix up trivial conflicts in Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt (the 'truncate_range' inode method was removed by the VM changes, the VFS update adds an 'update_time()' method), and in fs/btrfs/ulist.[ch] (due to sparse fix added twice, with other changes nearby).  * 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs: (95 commits)   nfs: don't open in ->d_revalidate   vfs: retry last component if opening stale dentry   vfs: nameidata_to_filp(): don't throw away file on error   vfs: nameidata_to_filp(): inline __dentry_open()   vfs: do_dentry_open(): don't put filp   vfs: split __dentry_open()   vfs: do_last() common post lookup   vfs: do_last(): add audit_inode before open   vfs: do_last(): only return EISDIR for O_CREAT   vfs: do_last(): check LOOKUP_DIRECTORY   vfs: do_last(): make ENOENT exit RCU safe   vfs: make follow_link check RCU safe   vfs: do_last(): use inode variable   vfs: do_last(): inline walk_component()   vfs: do_last(): make exit RCU safe   vfs: split do_lookup()   Btrfs: move over to use ->update_time   fs: introduce inode operation ->update_time   reiserfs: get rid of resierfs_sync_super   reiserfs: mark the superblock as dirty a bit later   ...

Some file systems can drop taking the i_mutex altogether it seems, like ext3 and ocfs2.  For correctness sake I just pushed everything down in all cases to make sure that we keep the current behavior the same for everybody, and then each individual fs maintainer can make up their mind about what to do from there.
