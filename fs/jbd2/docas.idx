f | checkpoint.c | s | 19K | 639 | Jan Kara | jack@suse.cz | 1331693125 |  | jbd2: remove bh_state lock from checkpointing code  All accesses to checkpointing entries in journal_head are protected by j_list_lock. Thus __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint() doesn't really need bh_state lock.  Also the only part of journal head that the rest of checkpointing code needs to check is jh->b_transaction which is safe to read under j_list_lock.  So we can safely remove bh_state lock from all of checkpointing code which makes it considerably prettier.  Signed-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz> Signed-off-by: "Theodore Ts'o" <tytso@mit.edu>
