We already have the on-disk value in the dinode, and the separate in-memory copy that we need for regular files only in the XFS inode.  Remove the xfs_inode i_size field and change the XFS_ISIZE macro to use the VFS inode i_size field for regular files.  Switch code that was directly accessing the i_size field in the xfs_inode to XFS_ISIZE, or in cases where we are limited to regular files direct access of the VFS inode i_size field.  This also allows dropping some fairly complicated code in the write path which dealt with keeping the xfs_inode i_size uptodate with the VFS i_size that is getting updated inside ->write_end.  Note that we do not bother resetting the VFS i_size when truncating a file that gets freed to zero as there is no point in doing so because the VFS inode is no longer in use at this point.  Just relax the assert in xfs_ifree to only check the on-disk size instead.

This is now easily doable given that we have very few places left that write delwri buffers:   - log recovery: 	Only done at mount time, and already forcing out the buffers 	synchronously using xfs_flush_buftarg   - quotacheck: 	Same story.   - dquot reclaim: 	Writes out dirty dquots on the LRU under memory pressure.  We might 	want to look into doing more of this via xfsaild, but it's already 	more optimal than the synchronous inode reclaim that writes each 	buffer synchronously.   - xfsaild: 	This is the main beneficiary of the change.  By keeping a local list 	of buffers to write we reduce latency of writing out buffers, and 	more importably we can remove all the delwri list promotions which 	were hitting the buffer cache hard under sustained metadata loads.  The implementation is very straight forward - xfs_buf_delwri_queue now gets a new list_head pointer that it adds the delwri buffers to, and all callers need to eventually submit the list using xfs_buf_delwi_submit or xfs_buf_delwi_submit_nowait.  Buffers that already are on a delwri list are skipped in xfs_buf_delwri_queue, assuming they already are on another delwri list.  The biggest change to pass down the buffer list was done to the AIL pushing. Now that we operate on buffers the trylock, push and pushbuf log item methods are merged into a single push routine, which tries to lock the item, and if possible add the buffer that needs writeback to the buffer list. This leads to much simpler code than the previous split but requires the individual IOP_PUSH instances to unlock and reacquire the AIL around calls to blocking routines.  Given that xfsailds now also handle writing out buffers, the conditions for log forcing and the sleep times needed some small changes.  The most important one is that we consider an AIL busy as long we still have buffers to push, and the other one is that we do increment the pushed LSN for buffers that are under flushing at this moment, but still count them towards the stuck items for restart purposes.  Without this we could hammer on stuck items without ever forcing the log and not make progress under heavy random delete workloads on fast flash storage devices.

Always use the generic xfs_btree_block type instead of the short / long structures. Add XFS_BTREE_SBLOCK_LEN / XFS_BTREE_LBLOCK_LEN defines for the length of a short / long form block. The rationale for this is that we will grow more btree block header variants to support CRCs and other RAS information, and always accessing them through the same datatype with unions for the short / long form pointers makes implementing this much easier.

Revert back to use a kthread per filesystem which fixes all the above issues at the cost of having a task struct and stack around for each mounted filesystem.

So introduce ->update_time, where we will deal with i_version an a/m/c time updates and indicate which changes need to be made.  The normal version just does what it has always done, updates the time and marks the inode dirty, and then filesystems can choose to do something different.  I've gone through all of the users of file_update_time and made them check for errors with the exception of the fault code since it's complicated and I wasn't quite sure what to do there, also Jan is going to be pushing the file time updates into page_mkwrite for those who have it so that should satisfy btrfs and make it not a big deal to check the file_update_time() return code in the generic fault path.

If a we have multi-block page for which an unwritten extent has been allocated, and only some of the buffers have been written to, and they are not contiguous, we can expose stale data from disk in the blocks between the writes after extent conversion.  Example of a page with unwritten and real data. buffer  content 0       empty  b_state = 0 1       DATA   b_state = 0x1023 Uptodate,Dirty,Mapped,Unwritten 2       DATA   b_state = 0x1023 Uptodate,Dirty,Mapped,Unwritten 3       empty  b_state = 0 4       empty  b_state = 0 5       DATA   b_state = 0x1023 Uptodate,Dirty,Mapped,Unwritten 6       DATA   b_state = 0x1023 Uptodate,Dirty,Mapped,Unwritten 7       empty  b_state = 0  Buffers 1, 2, 5, and 6 have been written to, leaving 0, 3, 4, and 7 empty.  Currently buffers 1, 2, 5, and 6 are added to a single ioend, and when IO has completed, extent conversion creates a real extent from block 1 through block 6, leaving 0 and 7 unwritten.  However buffers 3 and 4 were not written to disk, so stale data is exposed from those blocks on a subsequent read.  Fix this by setting iomap_valid = 0 when we find a buffer that is not Uptodate.  This ensures that buffers 5 and 6 are not added to the same ioend as buffers 1 and 2.  Later these blocks will be converted into two separate real extents, leaving the blocks in between unwritten.

The problem is that xfs_buf_alloc() sets b_bn to -1 and thus effectively every buffer is straddling a page boundary which causes xfs_buf_allocate_memory() to allocate two pages and use vmalloc() for access which is unnecessary.  Dave says xfs_buf_alloc() doesn't need to set b_bn to -1 anymore since the buffer is inserted into the cache only after being fully initialized now. So just make xfs_buf_alloc() fill in proper block number from the beginning.

The inode item is then marked as flushing, which causes xfsaild to spin and leaves the filesystem stalled. This is reproduced by running xfstests 273 in a loop for an extended period of time.  Check for stale inodes before the flush lock. This marks the inode as pinned, leads to a log flush and allows the filesystem to proceed.
