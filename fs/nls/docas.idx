f | nls_utf8.c | s | 1.2K | 56 | Alan Stern | stern@rowland.harvard.edu | 1245127483 |  | NLS: update handling of Unicode  This patch (as1239) updates the kernel's treatment of Unicode.  The character-set conversion routines are well behind the current state of the Unicode specification: They don't recognize the existence of code points beyond plane 0 or of surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding.  The old wchar_t 16-bit type is retained because it's still used in lots of places.  This shouldn't cause any new problems; if a conversion now results in an invalid 16-bit code then before it must have yielded an undefined code.  Difficult-to-read names like "utf_mbstowcs" are replaced with more transparent names like "utf8s_to_utf16s" and the ordering of the parameters is rationalized (buffer lengths come immediate after the pointers they refer to, and the inputs precede the outputs). Fortunately the low-level conversion routines are used in only a few places; the interfaces to the higher-level uni2char and char2uni methods have been left unchanged.
