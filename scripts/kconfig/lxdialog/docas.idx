Quote Tim Bird:  || I've been bitten by this numerous times.  I most often || use ftrace on ARM, but when I go back to x86, I almost || always go through a sequence of searching for the || function graph tracer in the menus, then realizing it's || completely missing until I disable CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE. || || Is there any way to have the menu item appear, but be || unsettable unless the SIZE option is disabled?  I'm || not a Kconfig guru...  I myself found this useful too. For example, I need to test ftrace/tracing and want to be sure all the tracing features are enabled, so I  enter the "Tracers" menu, and press <Z> to see if there is any config hidden.  I also noticed gconfig and xconfig have a button "Show all options", but that's a bit too much, and I think normally what we are not interested in those configs which have no prompt thus can't be changed by users.  Exmaple:        --- Tracers       -*-   Kernel Function Tracer       - -     Kernel Function Graph Tracer       [*]   Interrupts-off Latency Tracer       - -   Preemption-off Latency Tracer       [*]   Sysprof Tracer  Here you can see 2 tracers are not selectable, and then can find out how to make them selectable.

f | check-lxdialog.sh | s | 1.7K | 77 | Junio C Hamano | gitster@pobox.com | 1284984571 |  | kconfig: fix menuconfig on debian lenny  In 60f33b8 (kconfig: get rid of stray a.o, support ncursesw, 2006-01-15), support to link menuconfig with ncursesw library was added.  To compute the linker command option -l, we check "libncursesw.{so,a,dylib}" to allow ncursesw to be used as a replacement ncurses.  However, when checking what header file to include, we do not check /usr/include/ncursesw directory.  Add /usr/include/ncursesw to the list of directories that are checked. With this patch, on my Debian Lenny box with libncursesw5-dev package but not libncurses5-dev package, I can say "make menuconfig".
