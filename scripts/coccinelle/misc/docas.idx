f | ifcol.cocci | g | 1.2K |  | Nicolas Palix | npalix@diku.dk | 1283247793 |  | Coccinelle: Add misc/ifcol.cocci  Find confusingly indented code in or after an if.  An if branch should be indented.  The code following an if should not be indented. Sometimes, code after an if that is indented is actually intended to be part of the if branch.  This has a high rate of false positives, because Coccinelle's column calculation does not distinguish between spaces and tabs, so code that is not visually aligned may be considered to be in the same column.
