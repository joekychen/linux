f | eno.cocci | g | 1.2K |  | Julia Lawall | Julia.Lawall@lip6.fr | 1326582346 |  | scripts/coccinelle: improve the coverage of some semantic patches  This patch ensures that all semantic patches in the scripts/coccinelle directory provide the report option.  Report messages that include line numbers now have the line number preceded by "line" for easier subsequent processing.

f | deref_null.cocci | g | 4.3K |  | Julia Lawall | julia@diku.dk | 1291375621 |  | scripts/coccinelle: update for compatability with Coccinelle 0.2.4  For doubleinit.cocci, Coccinelle 0.2.4 requires a comma after ... in a field list.  Coccinelle also now behaves gracefully when a definition is provided for a virtual that doesn't exist, so there is no need for the semantic patch code to check for this case.  Updated the documentation to reflect the fact that the best results will now be obtained with Coccinelle version 0.2.4 or later.  Signed-off-by: Julia Lawall <julia@diku.dk>
f | kmerr.cocci | g | 1.6K |  | Nicolas Palix | npalix@diku.dk | 1283247473 |  | Coccinelle: Add null/kmerr.cocci  This semantic patch looks for kmalloc etc that are not followed by a NULL check.  It only gives a report in the case where there is some error handling code later in the function, which may be helpful in determining what the error handling code for the call to kmalloc etc should be.
