I still need to send a few checkpoint/restore patches.  I've been   wobbly about merging them because I'm wobbly about the overall   prospects for success of the project.  But after speaking with Pavel   at the LSF conference, it sounds like they're further toward   completion than I feared - apparently davem is at the "has stopped   complaining" stage regarding the net changes.  So I need to go back   and re-review those patchs and their (lengthy) discussion."  * emailed from Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>: (16 patches)   memcg swap: use mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap fix   backlight: add driver for DA9052/53 PMIC v1   C6X: use set_current_blocked() and block_sigmask()   MAINTAINERS: add entry for sparse checker   MAINTAINERS: fix REMOTEPROC F: typo   alpha: use set_current_blocked() and block_sigmask()   simple_open: automatically convert to simple_open()   scripts/coccinelle/api/simple_open.cocci: semantic patch for simple_open()   libfs: add simple_open()   hugetlbfs: remove unregister_filesystem() when initializing module   drivers/rtc/rtc-88pm860x.c: fix rtc irq enable callback   fs/xattr.c:setxattr(): improve handling of allocation failures   fs/xattr.c:listxattr(): fall back to vmalloc() if kmalloc() failed   fs/xattr.c: suppress page allocation failure warnings from sys_listxattr()   sysrq: use SEND_SIG_FORCED instead of force_sig()   proc: fix mount -t proc -o AAA
