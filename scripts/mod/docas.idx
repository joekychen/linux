Sure, it's a minor issue, but being consistent is nice.

This sorting and merging into the canonical sections are done by the linker.  Unfortunately modpost to generate Module.symvers file parses vmlinux.o (which is not linked yet) and all modules object files (which aren't linked yet).  These aren't sanitized by the linker yet.  That breaks modpost that can't detect license properly for modules.  This patch makes modpost aware of the new exported symbols structure.  [ This above is a slightly corrected version of the explanation of the   problem, copied from commit 62a2635610db ("modpost: Fix modpost's   license checking V3").  That commit fixed the problem for module   object files, but not for vmlinux.o.  This patch fixes modpost for   vmlinux.o. ]  Signed-off-by: Frank Rowand <frank.rowand@am.sony.com> Signed-off-by: Alessio Igor Bogani <abogani@kernel.org> Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

I'm not bothering with the full history, even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about 3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good infrastructure for it.  Let it rip!
