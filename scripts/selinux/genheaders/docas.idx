The name for any socket class should be suffixed by "socket" and doesn't contain more than one substr of "socket".

Adding new kernel classes and permissions can then be done just by adding them to classmap.h.  Signed-off-by:  Stephen Smalley <sds@tycho.nsa.gov> Signed-off-by: James Morris <jmorris@namei.org>
