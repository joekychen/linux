But after loading the module, it keeps saying hi every 10 seconds, this may be disturbing.  Also Steven said commenting out the "hi" helped in causing races. :)  [ Impact: make testing a bit easier ]  Signed-off-by: Li Zefan <lizf@cn.fujitsu.com> Acked-by: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org> Acked-by: Frederic Weisbecker <fweisbec@gmail.com> LKML-Reference: <4A00F6AD.2070008@cn.fujitsu.com> Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
