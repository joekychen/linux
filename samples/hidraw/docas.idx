Introduce temporary ugly workaround to define the ioctls "manually" in such cases, just to avoid miscompilation in allmodconfig cases.

It should use <linux/*.h> headers from the build tree, so use HEADERS_CHECK to require that those header files be present.  Change the kconfig symbol from tristate to bool since userspace cannot be built as loadable modules.  However, I don't understand why the userspace header files are not present as reported in Andrew's build log, since it builds OK on x86_64 without any of these changes.
